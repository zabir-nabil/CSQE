    "The initial symptoms of Covid-19 may vary from person to person, but common early signs include fever, cough, and fatigue. Some individuals may also experience shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, and headache. It's important to note that not everyone infected with the coronavirus will have all these symptoms, and some may even be asymptomatic. If you suspect you may have Covid-19 or have been in close contact with someone who tested positive, it's crucial to get tested and follow public health guidelines to help prevent the spread of the virus.",

    "Command Suicidal Hallucination as Initial Presentation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Case Report\tINTRODUCTION: Presently the COVID-19 pandemic is raging through the United States and worldwide. This enigmatic virus characteristically affects the respiratory system. Atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, and cases of encephalopathy have also been reported. However, psychiatric symptoms as the initial presenting feature is novel. We describe one such case. CASE PRESENTATION: 53-year-old man with no prior psychiatric or significant medical history was brought to the emergency department after ingesting bleach in an apparent suicide attempt. On initial presentation, the patient was uncooperative and withdrawn, though alert and oriented. He subsequently developed fever",

Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be a consequence of the respiratory-swallowing incoordination common in ARDS or may occur following the respiratory support interventions. In this commentary, we highlight the risk and complications of oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients with COVID-19 and urge medical and rehabilitation professionals to consider dysphagia a prognostic complication, provide appropriate referrals, and initiate early interventions as appropriate.",

Almost every aspect of the pathogen remains largely unknown, ranging from mechanisms involved in infection transmission, interplay with the human immune system, and covert mechanisms of end-organ damage. COVID-19 has manifested itself worldwide with a syndromic appearance that is dominated by respiratory dysregulations. While clinicians are focused on correcting respiratory homeostasis, echoing the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is also invading other end-organs, which",
