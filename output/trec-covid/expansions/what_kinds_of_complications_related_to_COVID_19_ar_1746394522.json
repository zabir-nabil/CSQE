    "Individuals with hypertension may experience more severe complications if they contract COVID-19. Some of the complications related to COVID-19 that are commonly associated with hypertension include an increased risk of developing severe respiratory symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a higher likelihood of developing pneumonia, and an elevated risk of experiencing cardiovascular complications like heart attacks or strokes. Hypertension can weaken the immune system and cause inflammation in the body, making individuals more vulnerable to the effects of the virus. Therefore, managing and controlling hypertension through proper medication and lifestyle modifications is crucial to reducing the risk of serious complications from COVID-19.",
    "Individuals with hypertension who contract COVID-19 may experience several complications due to the combination of the two conditions. One of the primary concerns is the increased risk of severe illness and complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. Hypertension can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections like COVID-19. Additionally, COVID-19 can further elevate blood pressure and potentially worsen pre-existing heart conditions in individuals with hypertension. This can lead to serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks and strokes. As such, it is crucial for individuals with hypertension to closely monitor their condition and follow recommended guidelines to reduce the risk of complications if they contract COVID-19."

    "what kinds of complications related to COVID-19 are associated with hypertension? There is evidence of the higher susceptibility and higher risk of unfavorable outcomes in comorbid patients, including those with hypertension. We summarize the available data on the association with the COVID-19 infection and arterial hypertension, and discuss potential risks. Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis.",

There is evidence of the higher susceptibility and higher risk of unfavorable outcomes in comorbid patients, including those with hypertension. We summarize the available data on the association with the COVID-19 infection and arterial hypertension, and discuss potential risks, e.g., the risks and benefits of antihypertensive therapy. Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells, may increase in patients using RAS inhibitors. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses challenge to healthcare systems due to high complication rates in patients with cardiometabolic diseases. We investigate specific risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explore the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality."

    "COVID-19: What are the risks in hypertensive patients?\tConsidering the number of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. A number of publications regarding the course of COVID-19 infection and its relation to comorbidities have appeared since December 2019, when the first cases of atypical pneumonia were diagnosed in China. There is evidence of the higher susceptibility and higher risk of unfavourable outcomes in comorbid patients, including those with hypertension. We summarize the available data on the association with the COVID-19 infection and arterial hypertension, and discuss potential risks, e. g. the risks and benefits of antihypertensive therapy (in particular, related to the blockers of",

    "Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with covid-19?\tAbstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the",

    "Recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney disease during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic\tThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges for all countries around the globe. Retrospective studies have identified hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and older age as risk factors for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There is a general concern that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases, namely those on immunosuppressive therapies and/or those with more advanced kidney failure, could particularly be at risk for adverse outcomes due to a compromised antiviral immunity. Uncertainties exist on how management routines should be reorganized to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection",
