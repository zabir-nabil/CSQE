    "Hydroxychloroquine has been a topic of much debate in its potential to treat Covid-19. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy, with conflicting results. Some early studies suggested a potential benefit in reducing viral load and symptoms in patients with Covid-19. However, as more research has been conducted, there is growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine may not be an effective treatment for Covid-19. Large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown no significant difference in outcomes between patients who received hydroxychloroquine and those who did not. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the safety of hydroxychloroquine, particularly in high doses or when combined with other medications. Overall, the current evidence does not strongly support the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19, and other treatments and prevention measures should be considered.",
    "Research on the value of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19 has generated mixed results. Some early studies suggested a potential benefit in reducing the severity of symptoms and improving outcomes for patients with the virus. However, further research has brought into question the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, with some studies showing no significant benefits and others even highlighting potential harms such as increased risks of adverse effects and no improvement in patient outcomes. The World Health Organization has suspended its trials on hydroxychloroquine due to safety concerns, while other health authorities recommend careful consideration and monitoring when using this drug for Covid-19 treatment. Overall, the evidence for the value of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19 remains inconclusive, and further research is needed to provide a clearer understanding of its efficacy and safety."

    "what evidence is there for the value of hydroxychloroquine in treating Covid-19 The severity of COVID-19 has resulted in a global rush to find the right antiviral treatment to conquer the pandemic and to treat patients. In a recently published study by Gautret et al. the authors concluded that hydroxychloroquine monotherapy and hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin reduced viral load. However, this trial has several major methodological issues, including the design, outcome measure and the statistical analyses. India has approved the use of HCQ for prophylaxis of asymptomatic health workers treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued Emergency Use Authorization for the use of HCQ to treat COVID-19 in adolescents and adults. This review summarizes the current evidence of potential therapeutic agents, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon, ribavirin, tocilizumab, and sarilumab. More clinical trials are being conducted for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating COVID-19. The recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) for two malaria drugs to treat COVID-19, based on thin evidence of efficacy, has jeopardized research to learn the drugs\u2019 real value against the pandemic coronavirus, say former agency executives under President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama. Since the most severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 appears to be a severe acute respiratory syndrome, azithromycin has been proposed as a potential treatment. Azithromycin is known to have immunomodulating and antiviral properties. In vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of azithromycin in reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, TNF alpha, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate T-helper functions.

    "QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and sudden death with short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as used in COVID-19: A systematic review\tChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are now being widely used for treatment of COVID-19. Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes and sudden death. Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects. Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We searched on MEDLINE and Embase, as well as in the gray literature up to April 17, 2020, for the risk of QT prolongation, torsades",

    "Ethical issues related to the hydroxychloroquine treatment prescription for Covid-19\tAbstract The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), has led to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, no drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Although the association between Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin efficacy lack of solid evidence-base, several governments have adopted it for all virology confirmed Covid-19 cases even for those who are asymptomatic. In the following, we aim to discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the use of this treatment association. We mainly tried to discuss the following controversial questions: Is it ethical not to treat a",

    "Should azithromycin be used to treat COVID-19? A rapid review\tBACKGROUND: There are no established effective treatments for COVID-19. While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2",
