    "The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence reveals valuable insights into the evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity of the virus. By comparing the genetic sequences of different isolates of the virus, researchers can construct phylogenetic trees that illustrate how the virus has evolved over time and how it has spread among different populations. This analysis can help track the origin and transmission patterns of the virus, identify new variants or mutations, and inform public health measures such as vaccine development and control strategies. Overall, phylogenetic analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the genetic evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "A Snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Availability up to April 2020 and its Implications: Data Analysis\tBACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 4 million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing",

    "Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of Point Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome\tOBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been rapidly spreading worldwide. Although the causal relationship among mutations and the features of SARS-CoV-2 such as rapid transmission, pathogenicity, and tropism, remains unclear, our results of genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may help to interpret the interaction between genomic characterization in SARS-CoV-2 and infectivity with the host. METHODS: A total of 4,254 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID). Multiple sequence",
    "Large-Scale Phylogenetic Analysis of Emerging Infectious Diseases\tMicroorganisms that cause infectious diseases present critical issues of national security, public health, and economic welfare. For example, in recent years, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza have emerged in Asia, spread through Eastern Europe, and threaten to become pandemic. As demonstrated by the coordinated response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza, agents of infectious disease are being addressed via large-scale genomic sequencing. The goal of genomic sequencing projects are to rapidly put large amounts of data in the public domain to accelerate research on disease surveillance, treatment, and prevention. However, our ability to derive information from large",
    "[Analysis on the SARS-CoV genome of PUMC01 isolate].\tOBJECTIVE To perform variation and phylogenetics analysis on the SARS-CoV genome sequence (PUMC01) isolated in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHODS The cDNA library of SARS-CoV (PUMC01 isolate) was constructed by means of random-priming strategy. Random selected plasmid was sequenced and the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-PUMC01 was assembled by conventional methods (The Genebank Accession No. of SARS-CoV-PUMC01 is AY350750). The variation and phylogenetics analysis were performed by comparing the PUMC01 sequence with other SARS-CoV isolates. RESULTS Ten variation sites were found by comparing PUMC01 isolate with",
    "SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Amplification and Sequencing for Effective Population-Based Surveillance and Control of Viral Transmission\tBackground With the gradual reopening of economies and resumption of social life, robust surveillance mechanisms should be implemented to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented. Methods We performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with",

The availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across the globe. The availability of whole genomes from multiple states in India prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in India. We performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from India, followed by phylogenetic clustering, substitution analysis, and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes. We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I / A3i) of",
