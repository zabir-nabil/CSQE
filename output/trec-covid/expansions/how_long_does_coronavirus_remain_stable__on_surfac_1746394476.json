    "Recent studies have shown that the coronavirus, specifically the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19, can remain stable on various surfaces for a period ranging from several hours to several days. The stability of the virus depends on the surface material, temperature, and humidity. For example, on plastic and stainless steel surfaces, the coronavirus can remain stable for up to 2-3 days. On copper surfaces, the virus may only survive for a few hours. Cardboard surfaces may harbor the virus for about 24 hours. These findings highlight the importance of regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces to help prevent the spread of the virus.",
    "Research studies have indicated that the coronavirus can remain stable on various surfaces for different periods of time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus may persist on surfaces such as glass, metal, and plastic for hours to days depending on factors like temperature and humidity. For example, it is believed that the virus can survive on plastic surfaces for up to 3 days. However, it is important to note that regular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces can help reduce the risk of transmission. It is recommended to follow proper hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the face, to prevent the spread of the virus."

    "how long does coronavirus remain stable on surfaces? Frequently touched surfaces of a university classroom that is cleaned daily contained viable human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). Tests of a CoV-229E laboratory strain under conditions that simulated the ambient light, temperature, and relative humidity conditions of the classroom revealed that some of the virus remained viable on various surfaces for 7 days, suggesting CoV-229E is relatively stable in the environment. A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the winter of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread around the world. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 survives and remains viable on surfaces for several days under different environments as reported in recent studies. These droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions."

    "A Study of Nonstructural Protein 1 of SARS Coronavirus\tSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encoded nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) orchestrates a multi-pronged mechanism to down regulate host gene expression, also known as host shutoff Nsp1 is a 180 amino acid long protein with primarily flexible structure that allows nsp1 to interact with various cellular factors during host shutoff to inhibit translation and promote mRNA decay Mutations of the surface residues of nsp1 either attenuates or augments its host shutoff function prompting the hypothesis that these residues bind cellular proteins that facilitate nsp1 during host shutoff To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we conducted a quantitative proteomics experiment by comparing protein",

The extent and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is far greater than previous coronaviruses that emerged in the 21st Century. Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (",
    "In vivo large-scale analysis of Drosophila neuronal calcium traces by automated tracking of single somata.\tHow does the concerted activity of neuronal populations shape behavior? Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently",

    "Droplet evaporation residue indicating SARS-COV-2 survivability on surfaces\tSARS-CoV-2 survives and remains viable on surfaces for several days under different environments as reported in recent studies. However, it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions.

    "Long term stability and infectivity of herpesviruses in water\tFor viruses to utilize environmental vectors (hard surfaces, soil, water) for transmission, physical and chemical stability is a prerequisite. There are many factors including pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water. Equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids. EHV-1 and recombinants of EHV-1 and EHV-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species, particularly in captive settings. Many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures, however, in",
