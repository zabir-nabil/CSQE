    "The protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, also known as the spike protein or S-protein, plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect host cells. This protein is a trimer, meaning it is made up of three identical subunits that protrude from the surface of the virus. Each subunit consists of two main parts: the S1 subunit responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, and the S2 subunit which facilitates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein features a unique structure composed of multiple domains, including a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. Understanding the intricate structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is crucial for the development of effective vaccines and therapies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a crucial role in viral entry into host cells. Structurally, the spike protein is a trimeric glycoprotein with each monomer consisting of two subunits - S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with the host cell receptor ACE2, facilitating viral attachment and entry. The S2 subunit is involved in fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, allowing for viral entry into the cell. The spike protein is heavily glycosylated, which helps shield it from the host immune system and also plays a role in viral infectivity. Understanding the protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is crucial for the development of therapeutics and vaccines aimed at targeting this key viral protein."

    "Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Priming by TMPRSS2\tEntry of SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of COVID-19, in the host cell is driven by the interaction of its spike protein with human ACE2 receptor and a serine protease, TMPRSS2. Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in",
    "Structural variations in human ACE2 may influence its binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\tThe recent pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is unarguably the most fearsome compared with the earlier outbreaks caused by other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-",

    "N-glycosylation network construction and analysis to modify glycans on the spike S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2\tBackground The spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is N-glycosylated. The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells. Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work. Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on",
