    "Yes, there are serological tests available that can detect antibodies to the coronavirus. These tests are designed to detect the presence of specific antibodies produced by the immune system in response to exposure to the virus. Serological tests are often used to determine if someone has had a past infection with the coronavirus, even if they were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. These tests play a crucial role in understanding the prevalence of the virus in a population and in identifying individuals who may have developed immunity to the virus. It is important to note that serological tests are different from diagnostic tests that detect the actual presence of the virus in the body.",
    "Yes, there are serological tests available that can detect antibodies to the coronavirus. These tests, also known as antibody tests or serology tests, are used to determine if a person has been previously infected with the coronavirus and has developed an immune response. Serological tests look for antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the virus. These tests can help healthcare providers understand the extent of past infections, identify individuals who have developed immunity to the virus, and track the spread of the virus within a population. It is important to note that these tests should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as molecular tests like PCR, for a comprehensive understanding of a person's COVID-19 status."

    "Serodiagnostics for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus-2: A Narrative Review\tAccurate serologic tests to detect host antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be critical for the public health response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Many use cases are envisaged, including complementing molecular methods for diagnosis of active disease and estimating immunity for individuals. At the population level, carefully designed seroepidemiologic studies will aid in the characterization of transmission dynamics and refinement of disease burden estimates and will provide insight into the kinetics of humoral immunity.

While tests such as RT-PCR have applications in the immediate diagnosis revealing the presence of the virus, serological tests can be used to determine previous exposure to the virus and complement acute diagnosis. Antibody production can occur as early as 5 days post-infection. Both IgM and IgG specific anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies can be a useful tool to test faster and larger groups of individuals.

    "Review of Current Advances in Serologic Testing for COVID-19\tOBJECTIVES: To examine and summarize the current literature on serologic methods for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A literature review was performed using searches in databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Thirty-two peer-reviewed papers and 23 preprints were examined. RESULTS: The studies included lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, and neutralizing antibody assays. The use of all major SARS-CoV-2 antigens was demonstrated to have diagnostic value. Assays measuring total antibody reactivity had the highest sensitivity. In addition, all the methods provided",
    "Serological responses in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection and cross-reactivity with human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and NL63.\tThe serological response profile of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection was defined by neutralization tests and subclass-specific immunofluorescent (IF) tests using serial sera from 20 patients. SARS CoV total immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgG, IgA, and IgM [IgGAM]) was the first antibody to be detectable. There was no difference in time to seroconversion between the patients who survived (n = 14) and those who died (n = 6). Although SARS CoV IgM was still detectable by IF tests",

One hundred and fifty-nine neotropic felids and 51 exotic felids from 28 captive settings in Brazil were tested. While antibodies against Feline parvovirus and Feline coronavirus (FCoV), Feline calicivirus and Bartonella spp. were frequently detected by serologic tests, antibodies against Felid herpesvirus 1 or infection with hemotropic mycoplasmas were less prevalent. Serologic evidence of exposure to Ehrlichia spp., Feline immunodeficiency virus, and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected"
