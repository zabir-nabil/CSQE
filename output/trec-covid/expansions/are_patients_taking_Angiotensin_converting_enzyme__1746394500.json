  "keqe_expansions": [
    "Recent studies have indicated that there may be a potential link between patients taking Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and an increased risk for COVID-19. ACE inhibitors are commonly used to manage conditions such as high blood pressure and heart failure, but some research suggests that ACE inhibitors may upregulate the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This could potentially increase susceptibility to the virus. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between ACE inhibitors and COVID-19 risk. Patients should consult with their healthcare providers for personalized guidance on managing their medications and individual risk factors during the pandemic.",
    "Currently, there is ongoing research and studies to determine whether patients taking Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) are at an increased risk for COVID-19. Some initial studies suggested that taking ACE inhibitors may potentially increase the risk of severity of COVID-19, while other studies have not found a significant association. It is important to note that the relationship between ACE inhibitors and COVID-19 is complex and not yet fully understood. Patients who are taking ACE inhibitors should consult with their healthcare provider for personalized advice and recommendations based on their individual health factors. As more research is conducted and more data becomes available, a clearer picture may emerge regarding the risks associated with taking ACE inhibitors in relation to COVID-19."

    "are patients taking Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) at increased risk for COVID-19? Potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, and Ang II (angiotensin II) receptor blockers. Coronavirus binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. There has been a lot of speculation that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes. We recommend that patients on such medications should continue on them unless there is a clinical indication to stop their use. Intravenous infusions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in experimental animals increase the numbers of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation. Patients who take ACEIs and ARBs may be at increased risk of severe disease outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigate or exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncertain. We evaluated the association of ACE inhibitors and ARB with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality among individuals with hypertension. The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in COVID-19 is debated. Several well-conducted observational studies show no increased risk from RAAS blockade in COVID-19 patients.",

    "Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers and the COVID-19 Pandemic: At Present There Is No Evidence to Abandon Renin-Angiotensin System Blockers\tDuring the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly. Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of",
    "Hypertension prevalence in human coronavirus disease: the role of ACE system in infection spread and severity\tThe prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and it appears to be related to an increased risk of mortality, as shown in many epidemiological studies. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system is not uniformly expressed in all of the human races, and current differences could explain some of the geographical discrepancies in infection around the world. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. As two",
    "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are distinctly different paradigms\tThere is current debate concerning the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), for hypertension management, during COVID-19 infection. Specifically, the suggestion has been made that ACE inhibitors or ARBs could theoretically contribute to infection via increasing ACE2 receptor expression and hence increase viral load. The ACE2 receptor is responsible for binding the SAR-CoV2 viral spike and causing COVID-19 infection. What makes the argument somewhat obtuse for ACE inhibitors or ARBs is that ACE2 receptor expression can be increased by compounds that activate or increase",

    "Should Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ever Be Used for the Management of Hypertension?\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly used anti-hypertensive medications in a number of clinical settings. They are often used interchangeably, but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be. We review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers. RECENT FINDINGS: In many clinical scenarios, the data supports similar efficacy between ACE inhibitors and ARBs",

The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in COVID-19 is debated. Several well-conducted observational studies show no increased risk from RAAS blockade in COVID-19 patients and are detailed in this brief review. The Swedish Society of Hypertension, Stroke and Vascular Medicine supports current recommendations that ongoing RAAS blockade should be maintained in patients with COVID-19."
