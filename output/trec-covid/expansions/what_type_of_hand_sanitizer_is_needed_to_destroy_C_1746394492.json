Alcohol-based hand sanitizers have been proven to be effective in killing a wide range of viruses, including the novel coronavirus. When using hand sanitizer, it is essential to cover all surfaces of the hands and rub them together until they are dry. This helps ensure that the sanitizer has enough contact time to effectively destroy any potential viruses present on the skin. Remember to also wash your hands with soap and water regularly as an additional measure to protect against Covid-19."

    "Outbreaks where food workers have been implicated in the spread of foodborne disease. Part 10. Alcohol-based antiseptics for hand disinfection and a comparison of their effectiveness with soaps.\tAlcohol compounds are increasingly used as a substitute for hand washing in health care environments and some public places because these compounds are easy to use and do not require water or hand drying materials. However, the effectiveness of these compounds depends on how much soil (bioburden) is present on the hands. Workers in health care environments and other public places must wash their hands before using antiseptics and/or wearing gloves. However, alcohol-based antiseptics, also called rubs and sanitizers, can be very effective",
