    "The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant implications on violence in society, particularly in regards to violent crimes. As the world grappled with the challenges of lockdowns, social distancing measures, and economic uncertainty, reports surfaced of an increase in various forms of violence. There was a surge in domestic violence cases, attributed in part to the confinement of individuals in close quarters for extended periods of time, as well as heightened stress levels and financial strains.\n\nFurthermore, restrictions on social gatherings and closures of public spaces may have contributed to a decrease in certain types of violent crimes, such as gang-related activities and street violence. However, the pandemic also fueled tensions and frustrations among individuals, leading to some instances of escalated conflicts and violent confrontations.\n\nThe economic repercussions of the pandemic, including widespread job losses and financial insecurity, have also been implicated in the rise of criminal activities. Desperation and limited options for earning income may have driven some individuals to resort to illegal means, resulting in a rise in property crimes and theft.\n\nOverall, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex and multifaceted impact on violence in society. While certain types of violence may have decreased due to lockdown measures, the overall toll on mental health, economic stability, and social dynamics has fueled an increase in violent crimes in various forms. Efforts to address these underlying issues and provide support to vulnerable individuals have become crucial in mitigating the impact of the pandemic on violence in communities.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a multifaceted impact on violence in society, especially in relation to violent crimes. One notable effect is the disruption to daily routines and social structures, which can contribute to increased stress, anxiety, and tension among individuals. These heightened emotions, coupled with uncertainties about the future and changes in economic stability, have the potential to escalate conflicts and lead to an uptick in violent behavior.\n\nFurthermore, the pandemic has also strained resources and support systems that are crucial in preventing violence and intervening in high-risk situations. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures may have inadvertently isolated individuals from their usual networks of support, leaving them vulnerable to experiencing or perpetrating violence behind closed doors. Additionally, the closure or limited operations of social services, mental health facilities, and community programs could further exacerbate underlying issues that contribute to violent acts.\n\nOn the other hand, the pandemic has also prompted innovative responses and preventive measures to address the escalation of violence. Law enforcement agencies and community organizations have adapted their strategies to focus on outreach, intervention, and de-escalation tactics to mitigate potential conflicts. Technology has played a crucial role in providing virtual support services, counseling, and resources to individuals at risk of violence or in need of assistance.\n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the intricate relationship between public health crises and violence in society, shedding light on the importance of addressing underlying social determinants and implementing proactive measures to prevent and respond to violent crimes during times of crisis. As we navigate the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, it is essential for policymakers, community leaders, and individuals to work collaboratively to promote safety, well-being, and resilience in the face of adversity."

    "Show me a man or a woman alone and I'll show you a saint: Changes in the frequency of criminal incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic\tOBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency of various crime types (property, violent, and mischief) in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: Crime data representing residential burglary, commercial burglary, theft of vehicle, theft from vehicle, theft, violence, and mischief are analysed at the city level using interrupted time series techniques. RESULTS: While COVID-19 has not had an impact on all crime types, statistically significant change has been identified in a number of cases. Depending on the crime type, the",
    "The Impact of Green Space on Violent Crime in Urban Environments: An Evidence Synthesis.\tCan the presence of green space in urban environments reduce the frequency of violent crime? To ascertain the evidence on this topic, we conducted an in-depth literature review using the PRISMA checklist. The search parameters included US articles written in English and published since 2000. More than 30,000 potential paper titles were identified and ultimately, 45 papers were selected for inclusion. Green spaces typically comprised tree cover, parks and ground cover. Criminal behaviors typically included murder, assault, and theft. The majority of the research reviewed involved quantitative methods (e.g., comparison of green space area to crime",
    "Impact of social distancing during COVID-19 pandemic on crime in Los Angeles and Indianapolis\tGovernments have implemented social distancing measures to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public, school closures, limitations on gatherings and business operations, and instructions to remain at home. Social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime. Crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property. Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government",
    "Impacts of California Proposition 47 on Crime in Santa Monica, CA\tWe examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and",
    "Has COVID-19 Changed Crime? Crime Rates in the United States during the Pandemic\tIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state-level governments across the United States issued mandatory stay-at-home orders around the end of March 2020. Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This study\u2019s purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime \u2013 as measured by calls for service to law enforcement \u2013 has decreased markedly.

    "Crime, Justice & the COVID-19 Pandemic: Toward a National Research Agenda\tThe novel corona virus COVID-19 has become a worldwide public health pandemic that has induced anomic conditions impacting daily routines. COVID-19 response measures specifically alter regular schedules and both restrict and expand opportunities for various types of crime while presenting unprecedented challenges for the criminal justice system. For criminologists and criminal justice scientists, the virus also presents natural experiment conditions allowing for real-world theory tests and observation of the relative effectiveness of practice and policy options under weighty conditions. Toward synthesizing scientific discourse and forthcoming empirical work, we suggest the benefits of a COVID-19 crime and justice research program and offer some anchoring concepts. Contagion,",
    "Crime Rates in a Pandemic: the Largest Criminological Experiment in History\tThe COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted the world in ways not seen in generations. Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before.
