    "The coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, can spread through various transmission routes. The primary modes of transmission include respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can then be inhaled by individuals nearby, leading to infection. Moreover, the virus can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, particularly the mouth, nose, or eyes. This highlights the importance of practicing good hand hygiene and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted through airborne particles in certain conditions. It is essential to follow recommended guidelines such as wearing masks, practicing physical distancing, and avoiding large gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.",
    "Coronavirus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. These droplets can then be inhaled by individuals nearby, leading to transmission of the virus. It is also possible to contract coronavirus by touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, particularly the eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, airborne transmission is a possibility in certain circumstances, where the virus can remain suspended in the air for an extended period of time. This makes it important to practice good hygiene, maintain physical distance, wear masks, and improve ventilation in indoor spaces to reduce the risk of transmission."

    "what are the transmission routes of coronavirus? Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the culprit virus, is highly contagious and stable in the environment and transmits predominantly among humans via the respiratory route. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, it has demonstrated China's ability to identify unknown pathogens. At present, reports showed that the main transmission routes are respiratory droplets and indirect contact, other vertical transmission routes have yet to be confirmed. Based on current research, the main transmission routes are respiratory droplets and indirect contact. Fecal-oral might be possible, while aerosol, tear (conjunctival), and mother-to-fetus still have yet to be confirmed. Accumulating evidence suggests that this virus, like many of its related viruses, may also be an enteric virus that can spread via the fecal-oral route. Such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapidity and proliferation of this pandemic.",

    "Closing the knowledge gaps on MERS: three and half years since its detection, what have we learnt and what needs to be done urgently? (Editorial).\tThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov), first detected in 2012, continues to cause health concerns owing to the grave uncertainties that have surrounded the virus since it emerged. Three and half years after the first known human infection was detected, cases continue to be reported every month, over 85% of which have been from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Despite its low levels of transmission, the virus presents an uncertain future as a number of critical knowledge gaps on",
    "Facing the COVID\u201019 outbreak: What should we know and what could we do?\tA novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019 and caused a serious type of pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. This epidemic quickly spread across China and extended to more than 20 other countries. This commentary discusses the reasons for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 in three aspects: the infectious sources, including the biological nature of the virus; the susceptible population; and the transmission routes. The current situations and suggestions regarding the control of the disease are summarized. This article is protected",
    "Tissue Distribution of the MERS-Coronavirus Receptor in Bats\tMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been shown to infect both humans and dromedary camels using dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as its receptor. The distribution of DPP4 in the respiratory tract tissues of humans and camels reflects MERS-CoV tropism. Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and",

    "Role of fomites in SARS transmission during the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong\tThe epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a significant effect on global society in the early 2000s and the potential of its resurgence exists. Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important"
