    "Several types of rapid testing for Covid-19 have been developed to quickly and effectively detect the presence of the virus. One commonly used method is the antigen test, which detects specific proteins on the surface of the virus. This test provides results in a shorter period of time compared to the PCR test and can be useful for screening in various settings. Another type of rapid test is the molecular test, such as the RT-PCR test, which detects the genetic material of the virus and is highly accurate. Additionally, some newer technologies like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR-based tests have also shown promise in providing rapid and reliable Covid-19 testing results. These different types of rapid testing methods play a crucial role in containing the spread of the virus and facilitating timely interventions to protect public health.",
    "Several types of rapid testing for Covid-19 have been developed to aid in the quick and efficient detection of the virus. One common type is the antigen test, which detects specific proteins on the surface of the coronavirus. These tests can provide results in as little as 15-30 minutes, making them useful for quick screening of individuals. Another type of rapid test is the molecular (PCR) test, which detects the genetic material of the virus. While PCR tests typically require laboratory processing, there are now rapid PCR tests available that can provide results in under an hour. Additionally, some newer technologies such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR-based tests have been developed for rapid Covid-19 testing. These advancements in testing technology have helped to expand testing capabilities and improve the efficiency of Covid-19 screening efforts."

    "SARS-CoV-2 in urine. - Should Endourologists be concerned and what PPE measures should be taken to protect the Endourologist when in theatre ?\tSARS-CoV-2 is usually transmitted through air however several recent reports have found the virus in urine. Only 187 urine samples have been reported to have been tested in the literature to date despite over 4 million cases of respiratory Covid 19 positive cases being reported worldwide. Of these 187 urine tests 6 were positive for the virus and this persisted in urine in once case for up to 42 days. The urine sample was still positive for Covid 19 despite respiratory swabs being negative. There is a potential concern therefore that Endourologists who generally perform",
    "The Role of Antibody Testing for SARS-CoV-2: Is There One?\tThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) brought with it rapid development of both molecular and serologic assays for identification of COVID-19 infections. While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types.
