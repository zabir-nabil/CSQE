    "Several new public datasets related to COVID-19 have been made available recently to aid researchers, policymakers, and the public in understanding and tracking the pandemic. Some of the prominent datasets include information on the number of confirmed cases and deaths by country or region, hospitalization rates, testing and vaccination data, genomic sequences of the virus, demographics of affected populations, mobility trends, and more. These datasets are crucial for monitoring the spread of the virus, studying its impact on different communities, developing effective interventions, and forecasting future trends. Researchers and organizations like the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and various academic institutions continue to release and update these datasets regularly to support ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19.",
    "Several new public datasets related to COVID-19 have recently become available, providing valuable insights and resources for researchers, policymakers, and the general public. Some of these datasets include information on COVID-19 cases and mortality rates by region, demographic data on affected populations, hospitalization rates, vaccine distribution and administration data, and genomic sequencing data of virus variants. Additionally, there are datasets tracking the economic impact of the pandemic, such as unemployment rates, small business closures, and consumer spending trends. Researchers and analysts can utilize these datasets to better understand the impact of the pandemic and inform evidence-based decision-making."

    "Does Non-COVID19 Lung Lesion Help? Investigating Transferability in COVID-19 CT Image Segmentation\tCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus spreading all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets. Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19 lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a",

This collection can prove beneficial in mining and analysis of the reaction of the Swiss media and the COVID-19 pandemic and extracting insightful information for further research. We hope this dataset helps researchers and the public deliver results that will help analyse the pandemic and potentially lead to a better understanding of the events.",
    "CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset\tAs the COVID-19 virus quickly spreads around the world, unfortunately, misinformation related to COVID-19 also gets created and spreads like wild fire. Such misinformation has caused confusion among people, disruptions in society, and even deadly consequences in health problems. To be able to understand, detect, and mitigate such COVID-19 misinformation, therefore, has not only deep intellectual values but also huge societal impacts. To help researchers combat COVID-19 health misinformation, therefore, we present CoAID (Covid-19 heAlthcare mIsinformation Dataset), with diverse COVID-19 healthcare misinformation, including fake news on websites and social platforms, along with users' social engagement about such news.

    "Public Opinions towards COVID-19 in California and New York on Twitter\tBackground: With the pandemic of COVID-19 and the release of related policies, discussions about the COVID-19 are widespread online. Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information",
    "Automatic Text Summarization of COVID-19 Medical Research Articles using BERT and GPT-2\tWith the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing urgency for medical community to keep up with the accelerating growth in the new coronavirus-related literature. As a result, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge has released a corpus of scholarly articles and is calling for machine learning approaches to help bridging the gap between the researchers and the rapidly growing publications. Here, we take advantage of the recent advances in pre-trained NLP models, BERT and OpenAI GPT-2, to solve this challenge by performing text summarization on this dataset. We evaluate the results using ROUGE scores and visual inspection. Our model provides abstractive and",
    "Unveiling COVID-19 from Chest X-ray with deep learning: a hurdles race with small data\tThe possibility to use widespread and simple chest X-ray (CXR) imaging for early screening of COVID-19 patients is attracting much interest from both the clinical and the AI community. In this study we provide insights and also raise warnings on what is reasonable to expect by applying deep-learning to COVID classification of CXR images.
