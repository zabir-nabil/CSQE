    "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, does indeed have multiple subtypes. These subtypes are commonly referred to as variants or strains. Some of the notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 include the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), Beta variant (B.1.351), Gamma variant (P.1), and Delta variant (B.1.617.2). These variants are characterized by specific genetic mutations that distinguish them from the original strain of the virus. It is important to monitor these variants closely as they may exhibit differences in transmissibility, severity of illness, and response to treatments and vaccines. Continued research and surveillance are crucial in understanding the impact of these SARS-CoV-2 variants on public health.",
    "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, does indeed have several subtypes. These subtypes are determined based on the genetic sequencing of the virus. Currently, the main subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 that have been identified include the original strain that emerged in Wuhan, China, as well as various mutations and variants that have since been detected worldwide. Some of the prominent variants include the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and more recently, the Omicron variant. Monitoring these subtypes is important for understanding how the virus is evolving and spreading, as well as for developing effective strategies for prevention and control."

    "Masking the general population might attenuate COVID-19 outbreaks\tThe effect of masking the general population on a COVID-19 epidemic is estimated by computer simulation using two separate state-of-the-art web-based softwares, one of them calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The questions addressed are these: 1. Can mask use by the general population limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a country? 2. What types of masks exist, and how elaborate must a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be applied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some possible future research questions regarding masks",
    "Is SARS-CoV-2 Vertically Transmitted?\tAt the end of 2019, in Wuhan (China), the onset of a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was observed. The disease, named COVID-19, has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to critical, and for some patients the disease is even fatal. Apparently, being a child or being pregnant does not represent an additional risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this mini-review was to investigate what is in the scientific literature, so far, in regard to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data were obtained independently by the two",
    "Genetic Grouping of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Sequences using Informative Subtype Markers for Pandemic Spread Visualization\tWe propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for",
    "SARS-CoV-2 is well adapted for humans. What does this mean for re-emergence?\tIn a side-by-side comparison of evolutionary dynamics between the 2019/2020 SARS-CoV-2 and the 2003 SARS-CoV, we were surprised to find that SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in the late phase of the 2003 epidemic after SARS-CoV had developed several advantageous adaptations for human transmission. Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted",

    "Understanding Coronavirus\tSince the identification of the first cases of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there has been a significant amount of confusion regarding the origin and spread of the so-called 'coronavirus', officially named SARS-CoV-2, and the cause of the disease COVID-19 Conflicting messages from the media and officials across different countries and organizations, the abundance of disparate sources of information, unfounded conspiracy theories on the origins of the newly emerging virus and the inconsistent public health measures across different countries, have all served to increase the level of anxiety in the population Where did the virus come from? How is it transmitted? How does it cause disease?",
    "The Coronavirus Pandemic: What Does the Evidence Show?\tCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world. The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been",

Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth.

Therefore, we analyzed the S gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the antigenicity and immunogenicity of this virus in this study. In phylogenetic analysis, two subtypes (SARS-CoV-2a and -b) were confirmed within SARS-CoV-2 strains. These two subtypes were divided by a novel synonymous mutation of D614G.
