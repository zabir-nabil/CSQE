    "The coronavirus and seasonal flu are both contagious respiratory illnesses caused by different viruses. However, there are several key differences between the two. One of the main distinctions is the origin of these viruses - the coronavirus is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, while the seasonal flu is caused by different strains of the influenza virus.\n\nIn terms of symptoms, both coronavirus and flu can cause fever, cough, fatigue, and body aches. However, the coronavirus tends to lead to more severe respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath and pneumonia, which can result in serious complications. On the other hand, the flu typically presents with more sudden onset of symptoms such as headache, sore throat, and stuffy nose.\n\nAnother significant difference is the availability of vaccines. While there are vaccines for the seasonal flu that can help prevent infection or reduce the severity of symptoms, there was initially no vaccine for COVID-19 when it first emerged. However, vaccines for the coronavirus have since been developed and are now widely available.\n\nIn terms of transmission, both viruses primarily spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. However, the coronavirus is thought to be more contagious than the flu, and can also spread through aerosols in poorly ventilated indoor spaces.\n\nOverall, while both the coronavirus and seasonal flu can cause respiratory illness, the coronavirus tends to be more severe and can lead to more widespread outbreaks. It is important to follow recommended public health guidelines to prevent the spread of both viruses, including practicing good hand hygiene, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated.",
    "The coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, differs from the seasonal flu in several key ways. Firstly, while both viruses can cause respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, COVID-19 has shown to be more contagious and can spread more rapidly than the flu. Additionally, COVID-19 has a higher mortality rate compared to the seasonal flu, particularly among older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions. The incubation period of COVID-19 is also longer than that of the flu, meaning individuals may be infectious for a longer period before showing symptoms. Another significant difference is the lack of widespread immunity or vaccines for COVID-19, whereas seasonal flu vaccines are available annually to help prevent flu infections. Overall, while both viruses share some similarities, the severity of COVID-19 and its impact on public health make it a distinct and challenging global concern."

    "How does the coronavirus differ from seasonal flu? Since the identification of the first cases of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there has been a significant amount of confusion regarding the origin and spread of the so-called 'coronavirus', officially named SARS-CoV-2, and the cause of the disease COVID-19. Where did the virus come from? How is it transmitted? How does it cause disease? Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as 'seasonal viruses'as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words, meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. The recent 2019\u2010novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV, also known as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) has caused >2,622,571 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) in >185 countries, and >182,359 deaths globally.

    "Experience of a screening centre for influenza A/H1N1: the first 50 days.\tBACKGROUND The authors' emergency department (ED) served as Singapore's screening centre for influenza H1N1 cases. The aims of the study were to describe their screening experience and to compare clinical and laboratory features of H1N1 versus seasonal flu cases. METHODOLOGY The authors conducted a prospective observational study on consecutive patients aged 16 years and above presenting to a busy, urban ED for H1N1 screening over 50 days. Clinical, laboratory, radiological and PCR data were collected from the hospital electronic databases. Primary outcomes were proportions of confirmed H1N1 cases and their distribution of clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Secondary",
    "Understanding Coronavirus\tSince the identification of the first cases of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there has been a significant amount of confusion regarding the origin and spread of the so-called 'coronavirus', officially named SARS-CoV-2, and the cause of the disease COVID-19 Conflicting messages from the media and officials across different countries and organizations, the abundance of disparate sources of information, unfounded conspiracy theories on the origins of the newly emerging virus and the inconsistent public health measures across different countries, have all served to increase the level of anxiety in the population Where did the virus come from? How is it transmitted? How does it cause disease?",
    "Pollen Explains Flu-Like and COVID-19 Seasonality\tCurrent models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality. Meteorological factors alone do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be antiviral and allergenic, play a role in immuno-activation, and seems to create a bio-aerosol lowering the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics including COVID-19. We tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in The Netherlands with its 17 million",
    "Modelling the Extremes of Seasonal Viruses and Hospital Congestion: The Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital\tViruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as\"seasonal viruses\"as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words, meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of positive and negative cases,",
    "The utility of preemptive mass influenza vaccination in controlling a sars outbreak during flu season.\tDuring flu season, respiratory infections can cause non-specific influenza-like-illnesses (ILIs) in up to one-half of the general population. If a future SARS outbreak were to coincide with flu season, it would become exceptionally difficult to distinguish SARS rapidly and accurately from other ILIs, given the non-specific clinical presentation of SARS and the current lack of a widely available, rapid, diagnostic test. We construct a deterministic compartmental model to examine the potential impact of preemptive mass influenza vaccination on SARS containment during a hypothetical SARS outbreak coinciding with a peak flu season.",

    "Monitoring Influenza Activity in the United States: A Comparison of Traditional Surveillance Systems with Google Flu Trends\tBACKGROUND: Google Flu Trends was developed to estimate US influenza-like illness (ILI) rates from internet searches; however ILI does not necessarily correlate with actual influenza virus infections. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Influenza activity data from 2003\u201304 through 2007\u201308 were obtained from three US surveillance systems: Google Flu Trends, CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (CDC ILI Surveillance), and US Influenza Virologic Surveillance System (CDC Virus Surveillance). Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data. An analysis was performed to investigate outlier observations",
    "Public views of the uk media and government reaction to the 2009 swine flu pandemic\tBACKGROUND: The first cases of influenza A/H1N1 (swine flu) were confirmed in the UK on 27th April 2009, after a novel virus first identified in Mexico rapidly evolved into a pandemic. The swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years and for many, their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak. This study examines public understandings of the pandemic, exploring how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit seventy three people (61 women and 12 men) to take part in 14 focus group",
    "Forecasting the 2013\u20132014 Influenza Season Using Wikipedia\tInfectious diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world; thus, forecasting their impact is crucial for planning an effective response strategy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects 5% to 20% of the U.S. population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies. We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013-2014",
