    "The coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, can survive on surfaces outside the human body for varying lengths of time depending on the material. Studies have shown that the virus can remain infectious on surfaces like stainless steel and plastic for up to several days. However, on surfaces such as cardboard and copper, the virus may survive for shorter periods of time, typically up to 24 hours. It is important to regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to reduce the risk of transmission.",
    "The coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, can survive on surfaces outside the body for varying amounts of time depending on the material and environmental conditions. Studies have shown that the virus can remain viable on different surfaces for hours to several days. For example, on plastic and stainless steel surfaces, the virus can survive for up to 3 days, while on cardboard, it may last for about 24 hours. However, it is important to note that these durations can be influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and the amount of virus present. Therefore, it is crucial to regularly clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces to reduce the risk of virus transmission."

    "Methusaleh's Zoo: how nature provides us with clues for extending human health span.\tAs impressive as the accomplishments of modern molecular biologists have been in finding genetic alterations that lengthen life in short-lived model organisms, they pale in comparison to the remarkable diversity of lifespans produced by evolution. Some animal species are now firmly documented to live for more than four centuries and even some mammals, like the bowhead whale, appear to survive 200 years or more. Another group of species may not be as absolutely long-lived, but they are remarkably long-lived for their body size and metabolic rate. These species include a number of bats, some of which live",

    "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): An overview of viral structure and host response\tAbstract Background and aim As a result of its rapid spread in various countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, WHO issued an announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status from epidemic to pandemic disease. The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome",

    "HOW LONG WILL MY MOUSE LIVE? MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR PREDICTION OF MOUSE LIFESPAN\tPrediction of individual lifespan based upon characteristics evaluated at middle-age represents a challenging objective for aging research. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to construct models that predict lifespan in a stock of genetically heterogeneous mice. Lifespan-prediction accuracy of 22 algorithms was evaluated using a cross-validation approach, in which models were trained and tested with distinct subsets of data. Using a combination of body weight and T-cell subset measures evaluated before two years of age, we show that the lifespan quartile to which an individual mouse belongs can be predicted with an accuracy of 35.3%",
    "A Stakeholder Survey on Live Bird Market Closures Policy for Controlling Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Vietnam\tExtensive research in Vietnam and elsewhere has shown that live bird markets (LBMs) play a significant role in the ecology and zoonotic transmission of avian influenzas (AIs) including H5N1 and H7N9. Vietnam has a large number of LBMs reflecting the consumer preferences for live poultry. Under pressure to mitigate risks for H7N9 and other zoonotic AIs, Vietnam is considering, among other mitigation measures, temporary closures of LBMs as a policy to reduce risk of AI outbreaks. However, the efficacy of market closure is debated, particularly because little is known about how poultry traders may react, and whether",
    "Microbes, Transmission Routes and Survival Outside the Body\tMicrobes like bacteria, virus, parasites and fungi may naturally colonize skin and mucous membranes without any sign of illness, for a longer or shorter period, in all humans, animals, fish, parasites, plants and all other living beings. Some types may be more invasive in human tissue than others. Many microbes are free-living in the environment\u2014in water, soil and air and on equipment\u2014as a part of the normal microbial flora on the Earth. Most of them are not dangerous and live in peaceful symbiosis with other living beings and may also be transferred between living species, from man to animal",
    "Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis attenuated live vaccines undergo selection of subpopulations and mutations following vaccination\tIn this study, we were interested in determining if high titered egg adapted modified live infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines contain spike gene related quasispecies that undergo selection in chickens, following vaccination. We sequenced the spike glycoprotein of 12 IBV vaccines (5 different serotypes from 3 different manufacturers) directly from the vaccine vial, then compared that sequence with reisolated viruses from vaccinated and contact-exposed birds over time. We found differences in the S1 sequence within the same vaccine serotype from different manufacturers, differences in S1 sequence between different vaccine serials from the same manufacturer, and intra-vaccine differences",
    "The Science of Wildlife Disease Management\tIn its widest sense disease can be regarded as any impairment of normal functions. However, for the purposes of this book we will mostly restrict our discussion to infectious diseases, the agents of which are often described as parasites or pathogens. For convenience, these organisms are often split into two categories that reflect their broad characteristics, and their relative size. The macroparasites are multi-cellular organisms that live in or on the host, such as helminths and arthropods, while microparasites include viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The main functional differences between the two relate to their generation times, with microparasites exhibiting relatively higher within-host reproductive"
