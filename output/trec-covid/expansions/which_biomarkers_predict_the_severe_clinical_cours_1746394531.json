    "Several biomarkers have been identified as potential predictors of the severe clinical course of 2019-nCOV infection. One key biomarker is interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been found to be elevated in patients with severe cases of the infection. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, have also been associated with more severe outcomes in patients with 2019-nCOV. Additionally, D-dimer, a marker of blood clotting, has been suggested as a predictor of worse prognosis in infected individuals. Other potential biomarkers being studied include ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lymphocyte counts. Utilizing these biomarkers in clinical practice may help identify patients at higher risk for a severe clinical course and guide treatment decisions for individuals infected with 2019-nCOV.",

Among these biomarkers, elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and D-dimer have been associated with a more severe presentation of the disease. Additionally, lymphopenia, particularly a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has also been linked to worse outcomes in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Monitoring these biomarkers and immune cell counts can help clinicians identify individuals at higher risk of developing severe complications and adjust their treatment strategies accordingly. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of these biomarkers in predicting the clinical course of 2019-nCoV infection and to improve patient outcomes."

    "Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus\tRecently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.

    "Overcoming Barriers: The Endothelium As a Linchpin of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pathogenesis?\tOBJECTIVE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic involving >5 500 000 cases worldwide as of May 26, 2020. The culprit is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which invades cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. While the majority of patients mount an appropriate antiviral response and recover at home, others progress to respiratory distress requiring hospital admission for supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, deterioration to acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation, development of severe thrombotic events, or cardiac injury and dysfunction occurs. In this review, we highlight what is known to date about",
