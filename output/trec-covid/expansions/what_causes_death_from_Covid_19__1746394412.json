    "Death from Covid-19 can be caused by a variety of factors associated with the disease. The primary cause of death is often respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia caused by the virus. Covid-19 can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs, making it difficult for the person to breathe. In some cases, the immune system's response to the virus can cause an overreaction, leading to a cytokine storm that damages multiple organs and can result in organ failure. Additionally, individuals with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or compromised immune systems are at higher risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19. It is crucial for individuals to take preventive measures such as vaccination, wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and following public health guidelines to reduce the risk of severe outcomes from the virus.",
    "Covid-19 can lead to severe illness and even death primarily due to the damage it causes to the lungs. The virus primarily attacks the respiratory system, leading to inflammation, fluid buildup in the lungs, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, this can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs cannot provide enough oxygen to the body, ultimately leading to organ failure and death. Additionally, Covid-19 can also cause widespread inflammation in the body, leading to damage in other organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain, which can further contribute to mortality. Individuals with underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and compromised immune systems, are at higher risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19. The combination of lung damage, systemic inflammation, and pre-existing health conditions can ultimately result in death from Covid-19. Early detection, appropriate medical care, and preventive measures such as vaccination and proper hygiene practices are crucial in reducing the risk of death from Covid-19."

    "what causes death from Covid-19 The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as Covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. Reasons behind this might include Covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed many lives in the UK and globally. On 19 February 2020, the first official announcement of death from 2019-Novel coronavirus was made in Iran. Understanding the trends in causes of death for different diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic is important to determine whether there are excess deaths beyond what is normally expected. Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. There are increasing reports of a drastic drop in consultations and cardiovascular procedures in regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a consequent marked increase in total mortality that is not fully explained by COVID-19.",

    "Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal.\tINTRODUCTION Portugal is experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS Despite the inherent uncertainty, it is safe to assume an observed excess mortality of",

    "What we know about 2019-nCoV in Iran in the early stage?\tOn 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak spread rapidly in all of the World. On 19 February 2020, the first official announcement of death from 2019-Nov was made in Iran. As of 7 March 2020, there were 101,927 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, including 3486 deaths, reported in the World. In the eastern and Mediterranean region Iran with 4747 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection and 124 deaths, is in the critical stage. Therefore, there is a matter of urgency combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic. Here, we focus on symptoms and the",

Using the most recent report from National Records Scotland (NRS) on 29 April 2020, we examined the percentage difference in crude numbers of deaths in 2020 compared to the average for 2015-2019 by week of death within calendar year.

    "EXCESS MORTALITY FROM COVID-19. WEEKLY EXCESS DEATH RATES BY AGE AND SEX FOR SWEDEN.\tObjectives: Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden.
