    "SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals do develop immunity, although the duration and level of immunity can vary among people. Research suggests that most individuals infected with the virus will develop some level of immunity, primarily through the production of antibodies that can provide protection against future exposures. However, the longevity of this immunity is still under investigation.\n\nCross-protection, referring to the concept where immunity developed against one strain of a virus may provide some protection against related strains, is also being studied in relation to SARS-CoV-2. While there is evidence that previous exposure to common human coronaviruses may provide some level of cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2, the extent and duration of this protection are still uncertain. Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its implications for future cross-protection strategies.",
    "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, prompts the immune system to produce antibodies to fight off the infection. Research indicates that individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are likely to develop immunity, at least in the short term. However, the duration and strength of this immunity are still being studied. \n\nAdditionally, there is ongoing research on the possibility of cross-protection between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Some studies suggest that previous exposure to certain common cold coronaviruses may provide some level of cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2. This cross-protection could potentially impact the severity of illness or the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research is needed to confirm and understand the extent of cross-protection between different coronaviruses."

    "Cytokine Storm in COVID-19 patients transforms to a Cytokine Super Cyclone in patients with risk factors\tThe seventh human coronavirus SARS-CoV2 belongs to the cluster of extremely pathogenic coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are established to cause lower respiratory tract infection. The viral infection can be fatal as the disease advances to pneumonia followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Increasingly higher cytokine concentration on account of over-stimulated immune response against the virus, or the \u2018cytokine storm\u2019, is the reason behind the manifestation of lethal clinical symptoms. In this article, we discuss the immune pathogenesis of cytokine storm and its relation with SARS-CoV2/COVID-19",
    "SARS Cov2 infection in a renal transplanted patients. A case report.\tThe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can vary from an asymptomatic course to ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A kidney transplanted patient infected with SARS CoV2 infection showed a mild disease despite immune suppression. It is possible that Immunosuppression can \"be protective\" as the cytokine storm is an important factor in the disease story. Despite the good outcome reported in the present case report, is remains of vital importance the solid organ transplant patients use precautions in order to avoid the infection.",
    "Clinical exacerbation of SARS-CoV2 infection after fingolimod withdrawal\tThe role of disease-modifying therapies in patients with autoimmune disorders during SARS-CoV2 infection is controversial. Immunocompromised patients could have a more severe COVID-19 disease, due to the absence of an adequate immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. However, therapies that act on immune response could play a protective role by dampening the cytokine release syndrome. Fingolimod is a drug used for immune therapy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through the sequestration of activated lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. We report the case of a 57-year-old man with relapsing-remitting MS treated with fingolimod that showed a reactivation of",

    "New IgM seroconversion and positive RT\u2010PCR test after exposure to the virus in recovered COVID\u201019 patient\tTo date, understanding whether acquired immunity and presence of anti SARS\u2010Cov2 antibodies protects against reinfection is one the most important focus of the scientific community [1\u20102]. Several studies suggest that acquired immunity may protect upon further exposure to SARS\u2010COV2 [3\u20106]. Contrary to this picture, we describe a case of a patient recovered from COVID\u201019 pneumonia with positive serology, followed up by 6 negative nasopharyngeal swab\u2010PCR tests performed along 1 month, who later on, after exposure to the virus, presented another positive RT\u2010PCR test and a second IgM seroconversion.
