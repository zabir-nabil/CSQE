    "Individuals who recover from COVID-19 typically display a robust immune response against the virus. Studies have shown that recovered individuals tend to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are a key component of the immune response and can provide protection against re-infection by recognizing and neutralizing the virus if it enters the body again.\n\nIn addition to antibody responses, T-cell mediated immunity also plays a crucial role in preventing re-infection. T cells have the ability to recognize and kill virus-infected cells, providing an important defense mechanism against pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Research has suggested that T-cell responses in individuals who recover from COVID-19 can contribute to long-lasting immunity and protection against future infections.\n\nOverall, individuals who recover from COVID-19 show a sufficient immune response that includes both antibodies and T-cell mediated immunity, which collectively work to prevent re-infection. While the duration and effectiveness of this immune protection may vary among individuals, the presence of these immune responses suggests that recovering from COVID-19 can confer some level of immunity against re-infection.",
    "Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 typically exhibit a robust immune response, which includes the production of antibodies and the activation of T-cell mediated immunity. Research studies have shown that most recovered individuals develop antibodies against the virus, with varying levels of persistence over time. These antibodies play a crucial role in recognizing and neutralizing the virus upon re-infection, potentially preventing severe illness or transmission.\n\nIn addition to antibodies, T-cell mediated immunity also plays a significant role in protecting against re-infection. T-cells help identify and destroy infected cells, providing another layer of defense against the virus. Studies have suggested that T-cell responses can persist even after antibody levels wane, contributing to long-term immunity against COVID-19.\n\nOverall, the immune response mounted by individuals who recover from COVID-19 appears to provide sufficient protection against re-infection. While the duration and strength of immunity may vary among individuals, the presence of antibodies and T-cell mediated immunity suggests that most recovered individuals are less likely to experience severe illness upon re-exposure to the virus. Ongoing research is crucial to further understand the complexities of COVID-19 immunity and the potential for re-infection."

    "Characterization of anti-viral immunity in recovered individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2\tThe WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients.

    "T-cell-mediated immune response to respiratory coronaviruses\tEmerging respiratory coronaviruses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pose potential biological threats to humans. SARS and MERS are manifested as severe atypical pneumonia associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans. The majority of studies carried out in SARS-CoV-infected humans and animals attribute a dysregulated/exuberant innate response as a leading contributor to SARS-CoV-mediated pathology. A decade after the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic, we do not have any approved preventive or therapeutic agents available in case of re-emergence of SARS-CoV or other",
    "The underpinning biology relating to multiple sclerosis disease modifying treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic\tBACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19 that can result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can cause significant mortality, leading to concern that immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis and other disorders have significant risks for both infection and ARDS. OBJECTIVE: To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T",

    "Virus-specific memory CD8 T cells provide substantial protection from lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.\tUNLABELLED Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an acute human respiratory illness with high morbidity and mortality in 2002-2003. Several studies have demonstrated the role of neutralizing antibodies induced by the spike (S) glycoprotein in protecting susceptible hosts from lethal infection. However, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody response is short-lived in patients who have recovered from SARS, making it critical to develop additional vaccine strategies. SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells persisted for up to 6 years after SARS-CoV infection, a time at which",
    "Natural T Cell-mediated Protection against Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza. Results of the Flu Watch Cohort Study.\tRATIONALE A high proportion of influenza infections are asymptomatic. Animal and human challenge studies and observational studies suggest T cells protect against disease among those infected, but the impact of T-cell immunity at the population level is unknown. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether naturally preexisting T-cell responses targeting highly conserved internal influenza proteins could provide cross-protective immunity against pandemic and seasonal influenza. METHODS We quantified influenza A(H3N2) virus-specific T cells in a population cohort during seasonal and pandemic periods between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up included paired serology, symptom reporting, and",
    "Intrafamilial Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Induces Cellular Immune Response without Seroconversion\tBackground. In the background of the current COVID-19 pandemic, serological tests are being used to assess past infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This knowledge is paramount to determine the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post pandemic period. Several individuals belonging to households with an index COVID-19 patient, reported symptoms of COVID-19 but discrepant serology results. Methods. Here we investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in seven families, including nine index patients and eight contacts, who had evidence of serological discordances within the households. Ten unexposed healthy donors were enrolled as controls. Results. All",
    "Immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in swine and protection against subsequent infection\tUnderstanding the immune responses against Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is important to prevent infection and to design control strategies. We evaluated both systemic and mucosal immune responses to PEDV in pigs and assessed if prior exposure to virus protects against re-infection. Three-week-old pigs were infected with PEDV and immune response in blood, intestine, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was evaluated. At 30 dpi, virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of PEDV and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated. We found that PEDV RNA persists in the",
    "Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4(+) T cells via parenteral immunization\tThe generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM)) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T(RM) is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T(RM) are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci"
