    "Several drugs have shown promise in animal studies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir, originally developed for Ebola, has demonstrated effectiveness in inhibiting the replication of both viruses in animal models. Additionally, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in animal studies, although their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated. Other potential drugs that have shown activity in animal studies include favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin. These findings are encouraging, but further research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in humans.",
    "Several drugs have shown promise in animal studies against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Some of the most notable ones include remdesivir, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing viral load and improving respiratory function in animal models of coronavirus infections. Another drug, lopinavir-ritonavir, has also shown antiviral activity against coronaviruses in animal studies. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies targeting specific viral proteins have shown effectiveness in preventing viral replication and reducing illness severity in animal models of coronavirus infections. These drugs hold potential for further development and testing in human clinical trials to combat SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections."

Currently, repositioning of old medicines seems the most responsible strategy for potential cure and prevention COVID-19.
