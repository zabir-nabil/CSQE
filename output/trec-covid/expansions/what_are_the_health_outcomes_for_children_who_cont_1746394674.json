    "Children who contract COVID-19 may experience a range of health outcomes, although the majority of cases in this age group tend to be less severe compared to adults. Some children may have no symptoms at all, while others may exhibit mild symptoms such as fever, cough, or fatigue. In rare cases, severe illness can occur, leading to hospitalization or even the need for intensive care. Additionally, some children may develop a post-COVID condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which can cause inflammation in various organs and potentially be life-threatening. It is important for parents and caregivers to monitor children closely if they test positive for COVID-19 and seek medical attention if they show any concerning symptoms.",
    "Children who contract COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms compared to adults, with many being asymptomatic or having only mild respiratory symptoms. However, some children may develop severe complications such as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can lead to inflammation of organs like the heart, lungs, kidneys, or brain. While severe illness remains uncommon in children, it is important to monitor their health closely as complications can arise. It is also worth noting that the long-term effects of COVID-19 on children's health are still being studied, and researchers continue to investigate the potential impacts on physical and mental well-being. To protect children from COVID-19 and its consequences, it is crucial to follow public health guidelines, get vaccinated if eligible, and seek medical attention if any concerning symptoms arise."

Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in children at a specialist centre: outcome and implications of underlying high-risk comorbidities in a paediatric population Underlying medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease are based on adult data, but have been applied across all ages resulting in large numbers of families undertaking social shielding (vulnerable group). The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in children remains low to date. However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections. Pediatric coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis. Mortality in children appears rare.

    "Coronavirus disease 2019 in children: Surprising findings in the midst of a global pandemic.\tQuestion Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting millions of people worldwide. It seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age, and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population. What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?Answer The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages.

    "COVID-19 in Children with Brain-Based Developmental Disabilities: A Rapid Review\tBackground. The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in children remains low to date. In just a few months, COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide, and as of the date of this publication, the pandemic continues. Based on the current available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults. However, children with neurological and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of other viral infections. Objectives. To assess whether children with brain-based developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have complications or poorer outcomes following infection. Methods. We conducted a",
    "Has mortality due to other causes increased during the Covid-19 pandemic? Early evidence from England and Wales\tBackground: The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed many lives in the UK and globally. The objective of this paper is to study whether the novel coronavirus has also been associated with an increase in deaths in England and Wales for those who have not contracted the disease. Reasons behind this may include avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths that did not involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed",

    "Supporting children and families through the pandemic, and after: The case for a US child allowance\tAbstract The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a contraction in economic activity that is unprecedented in both its nature and speed. In doing so, it has exposed who is protected and supported by modern welfare states, and who is not. While the US has a relatively robust set of social insurance and assistance programs for older Americans and working-age Americans who become unemployed or disabled, it lacks \u2013 in contrast to many other wealthy nations \u2013 a comparably strong universal or wide-reaching mechanism to support families with children. The US emergency relief packages enacted to date will undoubtedly mitigate the",
    "Pausing the Fight Against Malaria to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic in Africa: Is the Future of Malaria Bleak?\tMalaria remains a major global health burden, killing hundreds of thousands annually, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, a Phase IV Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-linked malaria vaccine implementation was underway. However, in December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with many clinical, epidemiological, and biological parallels to malaria, was reported in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, and, as of the 3rd of June, 2020, more",
    "Opioid Use Disorder and COVID-19: Biological Plausibility for Worsened Outcomes.\tBACKGROUND Alarms have been raised that COVID-19 may disproportionately affect certain populations with substance use disorders, particularly Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), however warnings have largely focused on social risks such as reduced availability of services. Objectives: This commentary highlights three plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19. Results: Opioid-related respiratory depression may amplify risks of hypoxemia from COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Complex opioid immune modulation may impact host response to COVID-19, though the effect direction and clinical significance are unclear. Drug-drug interactions may affect individuals with OUD who are co-administered medications for"
