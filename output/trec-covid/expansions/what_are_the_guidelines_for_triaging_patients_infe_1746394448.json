    "When it comes to triaging patients infected with coronavirus, healthcare providers must follow certain guidelines to effectively manage limited resources and provide care to those in need. The guidelines include:\n\n1. Prioritizing patients based on the severity of their symptoms and likelihood of recovery.\n2. Following established protocols and algorithms for screening, testing, and treating patients with COVID-19.\n3. Implementing infection control measures to reduce the risk of transmission within healthcare facilities.\n4. Collaborating with public health authorities to report cases and monitor trends in the community.\n5. Communicating effectively with patients and their families about their condition and care plan.\n6. Continuously updating guidelines based on the latest evidence and public health recommendations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that patients infected with coronavirus receive timely and appropriate care while minimizing the strain on the healthcare system.",
    "When triaging patients infected with coronavirus, healthcare professionals must follow specific guidelines to ensure proper identification and appropriate care. The guidelines typically involve assessing patients' symptoms, exposure history, and risk factors to determine the level of urgency for treatment. Patients may be categorized based on the severity of their symptoms and the likelihood of complications. In a triage situation, priority is usually given to those who are critically ill or at high risk of deteriorating quickly. It is essential to isolate patients with suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus to prevent further spread of the virus within healthcare settings. Additionally, healthcare workers should use proper personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of exposure and follow established protocols for infection control. Regular monitoring and reassessment of patients are crucial to ensure that appropriate interventions are provided promptly. By following these guidelines, healthcare providers can effectively manage and prioritize care for patients infected with coronavirus."

    "Israel Ad Hoc COVID\u201019 Committee: Guidelines for Care of Older Persons During a Pandemic\tEarly on, geriatricians in Israel viewed with increasing alarm the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). It was clear that this viral disease exhibited a clear predilection for and danger to older persons. Informal contacts began with senior officials from the country's Ministry of Health, the Israel Medical Association, and the country's largest health fund; this was done to plan an approach to the possible coming storm. A group was formed, comprising three senior geriatricians, a former dean, a palliative care specialist, and a lawyer/ethicist. The members made every effort to ensure that their",

    "Ethicists, doctors and triage decisions: who should decide? And on what basis?\tWe report here an emerging dispute in Italy concerning triage criteria for critically ill covid-19 patients, and how best to support doctors having to make difficult decisions in a context of insufficient life saving resources. The dispute we present is particularly significant as it juxtaposes two opposite views of who should make triage decisions, and how doctors should best be supported. There are both empirical and normative questions at stake here. The empirical questions pertain to the available level of evidence that healthcare professionals would rather not be left alone with their 'clinical judgments' to make triage decisions, and to the accounts of",
    "Rapid De-Escalation and Triaging Patients in Community-Based Palliative Care\tCONTEXT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a rapid and unprecedented shift in our medical system. Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic?

    "Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: a retrospective case-control study\tBackground: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries. Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective",
