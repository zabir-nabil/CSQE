    "Individuals infected with Covid-19 who are asymptomatic present a unique challenge in terms of containment and prevention of the spread of the virus. Asymptomatic carriers are those who have been infected with the virus but do not display any symptoms of the illness. This makes it difficult to identify and isolate them, leading to potential unknowing transmission to others. Research suggests that asymptomatic carriers can still spread the virus to others, albeit at a lower rate compared to those with symptoms. It is crucial to continue monitoring and testing individuals, even those who do not show symptoms, to effectively control the spread of Covid-19. Public health measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequent hand washing remain essential in combating the virus, especially in the presence of asymptomatic carriers.",
    "Individuals infected with Covid-19 who remain asymptomatic present a unique challenge in the fight against the pandemic. While they do not show any outward signs of illness, they are still capable of spreading the virus to others, unknowingly contributing to the transmission chain. Research suggests that asymptomatic carriers are less likely to be tested for the virus and may go unnoticed, making it difficult to control its spread. Furthermore, the long-term effects of asymptomatic infection are not yet fully understood, raising concerns about potential consequences for both individual health and public health strategies. However, studies have shown that asymptomatic cases tend to have lower viral loads compared to symptomatic cases, which may impact their ability to transmit the virus. As more is learned about asymptomatic infections, public health measures and testing strategies will need to evolve to effectively contain the spread of Covid-19."

    "SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): What do we know about children? A systematic review\tBACKGROUND: Few paediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children, though more is known about other coronaviruses. We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures. METHODS: We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English",
    "Characteristic of COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients: early findings from two Italian Pediatric Research Networks\tDetailed data on clinical presentations and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in Europe are still lacking. In this descriptive study, we report on 130 children with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed by 28 centers (mostly hospitals), in 10 regions in Italy, during the first months of the pandemic. Among these, 67 (51.5%) had a relative with COVID-19 while 34 (26.2%) had comorbidities, with the most frequent being respiratory, cardiac, or neuromuscular chronic diseases. Overall, 98 (75.4%) had an asymptomatic or mild disease, 11 (8.5%) had moderate disease",
    "There are asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19. So what? Pandemic response implications\tAbstract Asymptomatic but infectious people have been reported in many infectious diseases. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers would be a hidden reservoir of COVID-19. Aim This review identifies primary empirical evidence about the ability of asymptomatic carriers to infect others with COVID-19 pandemic and reflects on the implications for control measures. Methods A systematic review is followed by a narrative report and commentary inclusion criteria were: studies reporting primary data on asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients, who were considered to have passed on COVID-19 infection; and published in indexed journals or in peer review between January 1 and March 31,",

METHODS: Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group for 2 full weeks. Their age ranged between 20 and 50 years to avoid any age-related hearing affection. Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were excluded",
