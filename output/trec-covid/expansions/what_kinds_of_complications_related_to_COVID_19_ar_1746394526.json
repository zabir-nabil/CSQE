    "Individuals with diabetes who contract COVID-19 may experience a higher risk of complications due to their underlying health condition. Some of the complications associated with COVID-19 and diabetes include poor blood sugar control, which can make it challenging for the body to fight off the virus effectively. Additionally, individuals with diabetes may be more prone to developing severe respiratory issues, such as pneumonia, leading to a higher likelihood of hospitalization or even intensive care unit (ICU) admission. It is crucial for individuals with diabetes to closely monitor their blood sugar levels, follow their healthcare provider's recommendations, and take necessary precautions to reduce the risk of complications related to COVID-19.",
    "Individuals with diabetes are at a higher risk for experiencing complications related to COVID-19 due to the impact of diabetes on the immune system and overall health. Some common complications that may arise in diabetic individuals who contract the virus include severe respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and increased risk of hospitalization or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Additionally, diabetes can further exacerbate inflammation and complications in the body, potentially leading to a slower recovery period. It is crucial for individuals with diabetes to closely monitor their blood sugar levels, adhere to their medications and management plan, and take necessary precautions to reduce the risk of complications associated with COVID-19."

Because the presence of diabetes and COVID-19 in the same patient is related to a poor clinical prognosis and a high probability of death, it is necessary to determine what findings allow us to predict a good or bad resolution of the disease in order to opt for a traditional treatment or a more incisive one. In this way, in the present work we analyze which laboratory parameters showed differences in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who",

    "Sex-gender-related therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.\tDiabetes is a chronic disease associated with micro- and macrovascular complications and is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes are among the most important causes of death in diabetic patients. Interestingly, several sex-gender differences have been reported to significantly impact in the pathophysiology of diabetes. In particular, sex-gender differences have been reported to affect diabetes epidemiology, risk factors, as well as cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes. This suggests that different therapeutic approaches are needed for managing diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications in men and women. In this review, we will discuss"
