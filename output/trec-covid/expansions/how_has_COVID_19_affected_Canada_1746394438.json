    "how has COVID-19 affected Canada The COVID-19 pandemic has necessarily affected the operation of Canada's Parliament and, thus, the activities of Members of Parliament (MPs). Here, we explore how the pandemic has affected the representational activities of individual MPs. Using a case study from Canada, this paper examines how the political dynamics of industry-Indigenous relations have changed and speculates about how these dynamics might continue to change in the future. The economic crisis has already intensified political conflicts and struggles between Indigenous peoples and mining, oil, and gas companies. The Canadian government underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. The Public Health Agency of Canada is proactive and has shown its preparedness for outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, and in dealing. On April 28, 2020, Members of the House of Commons sat virtually using Zoom.

As the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to unfold, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this crisis will have significant and lasting implications for the relationship between extractive industries and Indigenous communities in Canada. This article looks at this new disease and how it has affected the delivery of healthcare in Canada. The world is confronted by the current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which is a wake-up call for all nations irrespective of their development status or geographical location. The Canadian government underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. The traditional model of heart failure (HF) care in Canada, which relies upon a multidisciplinary team and clinic-based care processes, has been undermined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "Optimizing Access to Heart Failure Care in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic\tThe traditional model of heart failure (HF) care in Canada, which relies upon a multidisciplinary team and clinic-based care processes, has been undermined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continues, we will be challenged to improve or maintain the health status of those with HF by optimizing guideline-directed care despite physical distancing constraints and a reduction in the health care workforce. This will require development of new strategies specifically targeted at decreasing the risk of decompensation and resultant HF hospitalization. As such, we must quickly pivot to the adoption and application of novel technologies and revise usual care",
