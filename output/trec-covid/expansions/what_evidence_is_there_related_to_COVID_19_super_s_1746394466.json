    "There is mounting evidence suggesting that individuals known as \"super spreaders\" play a significant role in the transmission of COVID-19. These individuals are thought to be highly contagious and capable of infecting a disproportionately large number of people. Studies have shown that super spreader events, such as large gatherings or crowded indoor settings, can lead to a rapid spread of the virus to numerous individuals. Contact tracing efforts have also highlighted the impact of super spreaders in fueling COVID-19 outbreaks within communities. Furthermore, genomic analysis of the virus has revealed certain genetic markers that may be associated with super spreading behavior. Overall, the evidence suggests that identifying and targeting super spreaders is crucial in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and preventing future outbreaks.",
    "Super spreaders have played a significant role in the transmission of COVID-19, with certain individuals being responsible for infecting a higher number of people compared to others. Evidence related to COVID-19 super spreaders has been documented through various studies and real-world observations. Contact tracing efforts have identified specific events and locations where super spreading events have occurred, such as large gatherings, indoor settings with poor ventilation, and crowded spaces.\n\nOne notable example of a super spreading event was the Biogen conference in Boston, where a single asymptomatic individual led to the infection of numerous attendees. Genome sequencing data has also provided insights into how the virus spreads within communities, with some individuals showing higher viral loads and shedding more virus particles, increasing the likelihood of transmission.\n\nStudies have highlighted the role of social and environmental factors in super spreading events, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. Understanding the characteristics of super spreaders and the contexts in which transmission is most likely to occur is crucial for controlling the spread of COVID-19 and implementing targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of these high-risk individuals."

    "Super-Spreader Businesses and Risk of COVID-19 Transmission\tPurpose: The United States has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world to date, with over 94,000 COVID-19-related deaths. The true risk of a COVID-19 resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown. This paper aims to classify businesses by their risk of transmission and quantify the relationship between the density of super-spreader businesses and COVID-19 cases.

    "Comparison of transmissibility of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: Reanalysis of the Ningbo COVID-19 data.\tBACKGROUND Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the coronavirus has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate. The transmissibility of coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-squared tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate",

    "Super-spreaders in infectious diseases\tSummary Early studies that explored host\u2013pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events,",

In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading.
