    "The response of the coronavirus to changes in the weather is a topic of ongoing research and discussion among scientists and health experts. While there is still much to learn about how weather affects the behavior and spread of the virus, some studies suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and humidity may influence its survival and transmission. Warmer and more humid conditions have been proposed to potentially reduce the stability of the virus on surfaces and in the air, which could impact its ability to spread. However, it is important to note that weather is just one of many factors that can influence the transmission of the coronavirus, and following public health guidelines such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing hands regularly remain crucial in controlling the spread of the virus regardless of the weather conditions.",
    "The response of the coronavirus to changes in weather remains a topic of ongoing research and scientific inquiry. While some studies suggest that certain environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, may impact the survival and transmission of the virus, the overall consensus is that COVID-19 continues to spread in various climates and seasons. It is important to note that the primary mode of transmission for the virus is through respiratory droplets and direct contact, rather than being solely dependent on the weather. Therefore, practicing preventive measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and frequent hand washing remain essential regardless of the weather conditions. As research on the relationship between weather and the coronavirus continues to evolve, it is crucial to rely on guidance from public health authorities to effectively mitigate the spread of the virus in all environments."

Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. Understanding and projecting the spread of COVID-19 requires reliable estimates of how weather components are associated with the transmission of the virus. The statistical analysis suggests that the temperature changes retarded the growth rate and found that -6.28\u00b0C and +14.51\u00b0C temperature is the favorable range for COVID-19 growth.

    "Weathering the pandemic: How the Caribbean Basin can use viral and environmental patterns to predict, prepare, and respond to COVID-19\tThe 2020 coronavirus pandemic is developing at different paces throughout the world. Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID-19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle-income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness",

    "Climate Change and Human Health Impacts in the United States: An Update on the Results of the U.S. National Assessment\tThe health sector component of the first U.S. National Assessment, published in 2000, synthesized the anticipated health impacts of climate variability and change for five categories of health outcomes: impacts attributable to temperature, extreme weather events (e.g., storms and floods), air pollution, water- and food-borne diseases, and vector- and rodent-borne diseases. The Health Sector Assessment (HSA) concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks for several climate-sensitive health outcomes, with the net impact uncertain. The objective of this study",
    "Weather Conditions and COVID-19 Transmission: Estimates and Projections\tBackground: Understanding and projecting the spread of COVID-19 requires reliable estimates of how weather components are associated with the transmission of the virus. Prior research on this topic has been inconclusive. Identifying key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impact on transmission we study this question using one of the largest assembled databases of COVID-19 infections and weather. Methods: We assemble a dataset that includes virus transmission and weather data across 3,739 locations from December 12, 2019 to April 22, 2020. Using simulation, we identify key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impacts on transmission, design a statistical method to overcome these challenges, and validate it in",
    "Comparison of culturable antibiotic-resistant bacteria in polluted and non-polluted air in Beijing, China\tAbstract Background Air pollution has been a serious health issue in Beijing for years. Airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria could be a potential health crisis as reserve of antibiotic resistance transmission in environment. The composition and antibiotic resistance pattern of culturable bacterial community and how these are affected by air pollution remain unclear. Objectives This study aimed to compare the compositions and antibiotic resistance patterns of culturable bacteria in polluted and non-polluted weather conditions in Beijing. Methods Air samples were collected indoors and outdoors during polluted and non-polluted weather using six-stage Andersen Samplers. For each isolated bacterium,",

Since Nov 2019 the outbreak in China, the virus is spreading exponentially everywhere. The current study focuses on the relationship between environmental parameters and the growth rate of COVID-19. The statistical analysis suggests that the temperature changes retarded the growth rate and found that -6.28{degrees}C and +14.51{degrees}C temperature is the favorable range for COVID-19 growth.

    "Bats and Emerging Infections: An Ecological and Virological Puzzle\tMore than 200 viruses have been detected in bats. Some unique bat characteristics can explain the roles played in the maintenance and transmission of viruses: long phylogenetic history can have originated coevolution processes, great number of species are adapted to live in different environments, big mobility, long lifespan and gregarious behaviour of many species. To analyse zoonoses long longitudinal studies are needed with a multidisciplinary approximation to obtain the following eco-epidemiological data: colony size, number of bats per species, population structure, behaviour of each species, degree of contact between bats, social structure, remaining time of bats in the colony, colony type",
