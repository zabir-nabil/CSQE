    "Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome have been observed throughout the course of the pandemic, leading to the emergence of various variants of the virus. Some of the key mutations that have been identified include changes in the spike protein, which is crucial for the virus to bind to and enter human cells. These mutations can affect the transmissibility, severity, and immune response to the virus. The frequency of mutations can vary, with some mutations occurring more often than others. Monitoring these mutations is essential to understanding the evolving nature of the virus and developing effective strategies for controlling its spread.",
    "Various mutations have been observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, leading to the emergence of different variants of the virus. These mutations can affect various parts of the virus, including the spike protein, which is vital for viral entry into host cells. Some notable mutations include D614G, N501Y, E484K, and others. The frequency of these mutations can vary, with some occurring more frequently than others. For example, the D614G mutation is one of the most prevalent and has been shown to enhance the viral infectivity. Monitoring these mutations is crucial in understanding the evolution of the virus and its potential impact on transmission, severity, and vaccine effectiveness."

    "What are the observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and how often do the mutations occur? Using all available deep sequencing data of complete genome from all over the world (NCBI repository), we identified several hundreds of point mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 all across. We analysed 480 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences from the 1575 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available and identified 37 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions/site/year. Almost one-half of sequence changes were C\u00e2\u2020\u2019U transitions, with an 8-fold base frequency.",

    "Overwhelming mutations or SNPs of SARS-CoV-2: A point of caution\tThe morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reaching 3 Million landmark causing and a serious public health concern globally and it is enigmatic how several antiviral and antibody treatments were not effective in the different period across the globe. With the drastic increasing number of positive cases around the world WHO raised the importance in the assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic modifications that could have occurred in the SARS-CoV-2. Using all available deep sequencing data of complete genome from all over the world (NCBI repository), we identified several hundreds of point mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 all across",
    "SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution exposes early human adaptations\tThe set of mutations observed at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may illuminate how the virus will adapt to humans as it continues to spread. Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide",
    "Mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 reveals three mutually exclusive clusters of leading and trailing single nucleotide substitutions\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe at an alarming rate in the last four months. However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 480 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences from the 1575 SARS-CoV-2 sequences available and identified 37 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif",
    "How fast does the SARS-Cov-2 virus really mutate in heterogeneous populations?\tWe introduce the problem of determining the mutational support of genes in the SARS-Cov-2 virus and estimating the distribution of mutations within different genes using small sample sizes that do not allow for accurate maximum likelihood estimation. The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples (\u223c 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the",

To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a data set of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions/site/year.

    "No evidence for increased transmissibility from recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2\tThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which jumped into the human population in late 2019 from a currently uncharacterised reservoir. Due to this extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 to date are significantly associated with",
    "Sarbecovirus comparative genomics elucidates gene content of SARS-CoV-2 and functional impact of COVID-19 pandemic mutations\tDespite its overwhelming clinical importance for understanding and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, the protein-coding gene content of the SARS-CoV-2 genome remains unresolved, with the function and even protein-coding status of many hypothetical proteins unknown and often conflicting among different annotations, thus hindering efforts for systematic dissection of its biology and the impact of recent mutations. Comparative genomics is a powerful approach for distinguishing protein-coding versus non-coding functional elements, based on their characteristic patterns of change, which we previously used to annotate protein-coding genes in human, fly, and other species.",
    "Quantification of Intra-Host Genomic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 Allows a High-Resolution Characterization of Viral Evolution and Reveals Functionally Convergent Variants\tA global cross-discipline effort is ongoing to characterize the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus and generate reliable epidemiological models of its diffusion. To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results",
    "The origin and underlying driving forces of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak\tThe spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The"
