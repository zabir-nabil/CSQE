    "Re-opening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic comes with a myriad of considerations. On one hand, resuming in-person learning can have numerous benefits for students, including social interaction, improved mental health, access to resources like meals and support services, and better educational outcomes for many. Additionally, returning to the classroom can help parents return to work and stabilize the economy. \n\nHowever, the decision to re-open schools also carries inherent risks. The primary concern is the potential for increased COVID-19 transmission among students, teachers, and staff, as schools can be breeding grounds for the virus due to close contact and shared spaces. Additionally, children may unknowingly spread the virus to more vulnerable family members. Managing social distancing, enforcing mask-wearing, and implementing adequate cleaning and disinfection protocols can be challenging and may not always be successful in preventing outbreaks. \n\nUltimately, the decision to re-open schools must be carefully weighed against the benefits and risks, taking into account factors like community transmission rates, healthcare capacity, and the ability of schools to implement effective safety measures. Hybrid learning models or remote alternatives may offer a compromise that balances the educational needs of students with public health considerations.",
    "Re-opening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic comes with both benefits and risks. On the one hand, resuming in-person learning allows for a more comprehensive educational experience, fostering social interactions, hands-on learning, and teacher-student engagement that may be limited in remote learning settings. School serves as a crucial support system for many students, providing access to resources such as meals, mental health services, and educational support. Additionally, returning to school can have positive effects on children's emotional well-being and mental health by offering a sense of normalcy and routine.\n\nOn the other hand, re-opening schools poses various risks amidst the ongoing pandemic. The close proximity of students and staff increases the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission, potentially leading to outbreaks within schools and broader communities. Children, although less likely to experience severe symptoms compared to adults, can still contract and spread the virus to more vulnerable populations. Additionally, challenges in enforcing strict public health measures, such as physical distancing and mask-wearing, can further contribute to the spread of the virus within school settings.\n\nUltimately, the decision to re-open schools during the COVID-19 pandemic requires a delicate balance between the benefits of in-person learning and the risks associated with potential virus transmission. It is crucial for educational institutions and policymakers to prioritize the health and safety of students, teachers, and staff by implementing comprehensive and evidence-based strategies to mitigate the risks of re-opening while maximizing the benefits of returning to in-person learning."

    "COVID-19 Related School Closings and Risk of Weight Gain Among Children.\tThe COVID-19 pandemic is causing substantial morbidity and mortality, straining health care systems, shutting down economies, and closing school districts. While it is a priority to mitigate its immediate impact, we want to call attention to the pandemic's longer-term effect on children's health: COVID-19, via these school closures, may exacerbate the epidemic of childhood obesity and increase disparities in obesity risk. In many areas of the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic has closed schools and some of these school systems are not expected to re-open this school year. The experiences in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore suggest that",
    "Predicting the second wave of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI\tMarissa Renardy and Denise Kirschner University of Michigan Medical School The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we",
    "The invisible workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic: Family carers at the frontline\tThis is an open letter to acknowledge the essential and increasingly challenging role unpaid family carers are playing in the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter is written by members of the CAREWELL team, a HRB-funded project that aims to promote health and self-care behaviours among working family carers. Family carers provide care to family and friends in the community who need support due to old-age, disability and chronic illness. In many cases, family carers are supporting those who are considered most at risk in this pandemic meaning carers must reduce their own risk of infection in order to protect their dependent family members",
    "A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic\tDespite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can",
    "COVID-19 and the re-opening of schools: a policy maker\u2019s dilemma\tThe epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the world. In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school\u2019s closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus.

    "Time to restart: A comparative compilation of triage recommendations in dentistry during the Covid \u221219 pandemic\tBACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a enormous challenge for the health care facilitators. It has significantly affected the dental professionals in their clinical practices, hospitals and even dental schools. Due to the risk of cross \u2013 infection involved within in the dental setting, the dental professional is even scared to provide emergent treatment for a patient.

    "Medical students' preference for returning to the clinical setting during the COVID-19 pandemic\tOBJECTIVES: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread disruptions in the clinical education of medical students. In managing students' return to the clinical setting, medical schools face the challenge of balancing education, service, and risk considerations. To compound this challenge, medical students may prefer not to re-enter during a period of great uncertainty, leading to substantive downstream sequelae on individual, institutional, and national levels. Understanding students' views on resuming clinical experiences, therefore, is an important consideration. The purpose of this study was to assess medical students' preference for re-entering the clinical setting",
