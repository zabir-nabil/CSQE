    "An mRNA vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been developed as a promising tool in combatting the ongoing global pandemic. This type of vaccine utilizes a small piece of genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct human cells to produce a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the virus. By triggering an immune response, the body recognizes and builds defenses against the spike protein, preparing the immune system to combat the actual virus if encountered in the future. mRNA vaccines have shown high efficacy rates in clinical trials and have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies in several countries. They offer advantages such as faster production process, no risk of causing the disease, and potential for rapid modifications to target new variants of the virus. While ongoing research continues to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of mRNA vaccines, early data suggests that they are effective in reducing the severity of illness and slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",
    "mRNA vaccines have emerged as a revolutionary tool in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. These vaccines contain genetic material from the virus that instructs cells in the body to produce a harmless spike protein similar to the one found on the virus. This prompts an immune response, training the body to recognize and combat the actual virus if encountered in the future. Clinical trials and real-world data have shown mRNA vaccines, such as those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and reducing severe illness and hospitalization. They have also been shown to be safe, with common side effects being mild and temporary. The rapid development and distribution of mRNA vaccines have been key in controlling the spread of the virus and achieving widespread vaccination efforts worldwide."

    "Understand Research Hotspots Surrounding COVID-19 and Other Coronavirus Infections Using Topic Modeling\tBackground: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans, which eventually results in the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) around the world. The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis. Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of",

    "M\u00f6gliche Therapiestrategien bei Covid-19-Erkrankungen mit chinesischen Arzneimitteln\tIn view of the severe corona virus pandemic and the not yet foreseeable availability of causal therapy approaches (vaccination, antiviral drugs), it is of great importance to know what Chinese medicine can contribute to the treatment of Covid 19. According to a WHO report published in 2004, concerning the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, Chinese medicine was used in China both preventively and therapeutically in addition to Western medicine. In both these preventive and curative roles, treatment proved to be significantly effective. During the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, about 60,000 Covid 19 patients were treated with Chinese medicine in the Wuhan region",
    "Coronaviruses: important emerging human pathogens.\tThe identification of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 reaffirmed the importance of understanding how coronaviruses emerge, infect, and cause disease. By comparing what is known about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to what has recently been found for MERS-CoV, researchers are discovering similarities and differences that may be important for pathogenesis. Here we discuss what is known about each virus and what gaps remain in our understanding, especially concerning MERS-CoV.",
    "Revealing variants in SARS-CoV-2 interaction domain of ACE2 and loss of function intolerance through analysis of >200,000 exomes\tOur researchers took a look at a sequence of DNA known as the ACE2 gene. This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, it\u2019s drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is",

    "On the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2\tThere is no doubt that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is mutating and thus has the potential to adapt during the current pandemic. Whether this evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is",
    "The dynamics of humoral immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for reinfection.\tSARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 17 April 2020, it has infected 2 114 269 people, resulting in 145 144 deaths. The timing, magnitude and longevity of humoral immunity is not yet understood for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, understanding this is urgently required to inform the likely future dynamics of the pandemic, to guide strategies to allow relaxation of social distancing measures and to understand how to deploy limiting vaccine doses when they become available to achieve maximum impact.
