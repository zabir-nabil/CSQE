    "Mortality rates provide crucial information about the number of deaths within a particular population or group over a specified period. By examining mortality rates, we can gain insights into the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities. Moreover, these rates can help identify disparities in health outcomes among different demographic groups.\n\nOverall mortality rates refer to the number of deaths within a given population, usually expressed as a ratio or percentage of the total population. This metric gives a broad understanding of the extent of mortality within a specific region or country. It serves as a fundamental measure for evaluating the effectiveness of healthcare systems, public health initiatives, and social policies.\n\nIn addition to overall mortality rates, specific populations may be characterized by unique mortality patterns. For example, mortality rates can vary based on factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and geographic location. By analyzing mortality rates within specific populations, public health officials and policymakers can target interventions and resources to address health disparities and improve outcomes for vulnerable groups.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding mortality rates both at the overall and specific population levels is essential for promoting public health and well-being. By closely monitoring and analyzing these rates, we can identify areas for improvement, implement targeted interventions, and ultimately reduce preventable deaths within our communities.",
    "Mortality rates refer to the number of deaths in a specific population over a certain period, usually expressed as a rate per 1,000 individuals. These rates provide crucial insights into the health and well-being of a population, helping policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers understand trends and make informed decisions. \n\nOverall, mortality rates can vary widely depending on factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. In general, older individuals tend to have higher mortality rates compared to younger populations, as aging is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and other health conditions.\n\nSpecific populations, such as those with pre-existing medical conditions, lower income levels, limited access to healthcare, or belonging to marginalized communities, may also experience higher mortality rates due to disparities in healthcare access, education, and living conditions.\n\nAnalyzing mortality rates in specific populations allows for targeted interventions to address underlying health inequalities and improve health outcomes. By identifying and addressing the factors contributing to elevated mortality rates, public health initiatives and healthcare policies can work towards reducing overall mortality rates and promoting health equity for all individuals."

    "Estimating Lower Bounds for COVID-19 Mortality from Northern Italian Towns\tFor COVID-19 the Infection Fatality Rate or IFR - a crucial variable in epidemiological modeling - is difficult to estimate because many cases are asymptomatic and the overall infection rate is generally not known. Circumstances in the Italian provinces of Milano, Bergamo, Brescia, and Lodi allow estimation of lower bounds for age- and sex-specific all-cause excess mortality (a proxy for IFR) since anecdotal reports indicate some towns were close to fully infected. Using data from ISTAT on mortality from January 1 through April 15 for 2020 and the three preceding years, I estimate excess mortality by sex and age categories (0-14,",
    "Analysis of Austrian COVID-19 deaths by age and sex\tWe analyze the age and sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths in Austria. In accordance with international studies, the Austrian data also suggests that the risk of death increases substantially with age. The observed age dependency of the proportions of registered COVID-19 deaths in relation to the population sizes in the age groups is approximately exponential, similar to the age dependency of the general age specific mortality rate. Furthermore, we compare the general age specific mortality rate in Austria with the estimates of the SARS-CoV\u20112 infection fatality rate by Ferguson et al. (2020).

Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories",
    "EXCESS MORTALITY FROM COVID-19. WEEKLY EXCESS DEATH RATES BY AGE AND SEX FOR SWEDEN.\tObjectives: Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden. Design: We",
    "Global Mortality Impact of the 1957\u20131959 Influenza Pandemic\tBackground. Quantitative estimates of the global burden of the 1957 influenza pandemic are lacking. Here we fill this gap by modeling historical mortality statistics. Methods. We used annual rates of age- and cause-specific deaths to estimate pandemic-related mortality in excess of background levels in 39 countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas. We modeled the relationship between excess mortality and development indicators to extrapolate the global burden of the pandemic. Results. The pandemic-associated excess respiratory mortality rate was 1.9/10 000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2\u20132.6 cases/10 000 population) on average during 1957\u20131959.",
    "Mortality of Life\u2010Insured Swedish Cats during 1999\u20132006: Age, Breed, Sex, and Diagnosis\tBackground: A cat life insurance database can potentially be used to study feline mortality. Hypothesis: The aim was to describe patterns of mortality in life\u2010insured Swedish cats. Cats: All cats (<13 years of age) with life insurance during the period 1999\u20132006 were included. Methods: Age\u2010standardized mortality rates (MR) were calculated with respect to sex (males and females), age, breed, and diagnosis. Survival to various ages is presented by time period and breed. Results: The total number of cats insured was 49,450 and the number of cat\u2010years at risk (CYAR)",
    "Mortality among dentists in Taiwan, 1985\u20132009\tBackground/Purpose Controversy exists in the literature regarding whether dentists with multiple occupational exposures suffer from premature mortality. A cohort mortality study was conducted to evaluate the survival outcome and determine if potential exposure to harmful agents leads to premature mortality among dentists. Methods Using the Life Table Analysis System, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for a cohort of 11,700 dentists affiliated with the Taiwan Dental Association. These dentists were followed from 1985\u20132009. Reference rates were derived from cause-, gender-, and age-specific mortality rates of the general population of Taiwan and 18,664 Taiwanese internists, who were considered to be more socioeconomically proximal to dentists.

    "Explaining the Neolithic Demographic Transition\tThree main questions are raised in this chapter. 1. The part of the signal of the NDT which is demographically identifiable, based on the proportion of the immature skeletons in cemeteries, shows that a baby-boom occurred and, beyond that, with the onset of the change in the economic system, a fertility transition towards high values also occurred. What was the biodemographic cause of this fertility explosion, beyond the proxy variable represented by sedentarism? The cause is a major shift in the maternal energetics of farming communities relative to mobile foragers. In the energy balance there was (i) on the intake side, an underlying trend towards a",
