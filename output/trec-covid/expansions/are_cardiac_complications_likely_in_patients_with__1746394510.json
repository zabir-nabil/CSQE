    "Patients with COVID-19 may experience various complications, including cardiac issues. While not every patient with COVID-19 will develop cardiac complications, studies have shown that there is a likelihood of such complications occurring in some individuals. The virus can lead to inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, or other conditions like arrhythmias or blood clots that can affect the heart. It is essential for healthcare providers to closely monitor patients with COVID-19 for any signs of cardiac involvement and intervene promptly to prevent serious complications. Early detection and appropriate management are critical in reducing the impact of cardiac issues in patients with COVID-19.",
    "Recent studies and clinical observations have shown that patients with COVID-19 may be at risk for developing cardiac complications. COVID-19 is known to cause inflammation throughout the body, including the heart, leading to conditions such as myocarditis, arrhythmias, and heart failure. This inflammation can also exacerbate existing cardiovascular issues in patients with preexisting conditions. Additionally, the virus can directly infect heart cells, further increasing the likelihood of cardiac complications. Therefore, healthcare providers should closely monitor the cardiovascular health of COVID-19 patients and be aware of the potential for cardiac complications to arise."

We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

    "Spectrum of Neurological Manifestations in Covid-19: A Review.\tCOVID-19, in most patients, presents with mild flu-like illness. Elderly patients with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, are more likely to have severe disease and deaths. Neurological complications are frequently reported in severely or critically ill patients with comorbidities. In COVID-19, both central and peripheral nervous systems can be affected. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19 and has the potential to invade the brain. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the brain either via a hematogenous route or olfactory system.
