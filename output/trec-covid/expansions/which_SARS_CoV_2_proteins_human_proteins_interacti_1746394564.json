    "Recent studies have identified several key interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins that indicate potential drug targets for combating the virus. One such interaction is between the viral protein spike (S protein) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a critical role in viral entry into host cells. Targeting this interaction with specific inhibitors could prevent viral attachment and entry, providing a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.\n\nAdditionally, interactions between the viral main protease (Mpro) and human proteases, such as TMPRSS2, have been identified as potential drug targets for disrupting viral replication and spread within host cells. Inhibitors targeting these interactions could potentially block viral replication and reduce disease severity.\n\nBased on this information, several approved drugs have shown potential for repurposing to target these interactions and inhibit viral infection. For example, existing protease inhibitors like lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir have shown efficacy in inhibiting viral replication and may be repurposed to target SARS-CoV-2 proteins-human proteins interactions. Additionally, drugs targeting the ACE2 receptor, such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are also being investigated for their potential to disrupt viral entry.\n\nIn conclusion, the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins provide valuable insights into potential drug targets for combating the virus. Repurposing approved drugs that target these interactions could offer effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.",
