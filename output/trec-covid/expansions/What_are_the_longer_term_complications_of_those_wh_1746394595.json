    "Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may experience a range of longer-term complications post-recovery. These can include lingering respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, cough, and reduced lung function. Some individuals may also face long-term effects on their cardiovascular health, with an increased risk of heart conditions such as myocarditis or heart failure. Neurological symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, or difficulty concentrating have also been reported in some cases. Additionally, mental health issues including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may arise as a result of the experience of dealing with the illness. It is important for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to stay vigilant about their health and seek medical attention if they experience any persistent or new symptoms.",
    "Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may experience longer-term complications even after their initial illness subsides. These complications, often referred to as \"long COVID\" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), can vary in severity and duration. Common long-term effects reported by COVID-19 survivors include persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive difficulties (\"brain fog\"), muscle weakness, and lingering symptoms of respiratory issues. Some individuals may also experience mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. These longer-term complications can significantly impact a person's quality of life and may require ongoing medical care and support. It is essential for healthcare providers to monitor and address these post-COVID symptoms to ensure the well-being of individuals who have recovered from the virus."

    "What are the longer-term complications of those who recover from COVID-19? The spectrum of the disease varies from mild asymptomatic infection to severe disease with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. It is associated with a prothrombotic state and hence there is a risk of thromboembolic complications in critically ill patients, even after recovery. However, the duration of prothrombotic risk after recovery is yet to be determined. This study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and we compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable virus associated with a significantly increased risk of complications among the infected population. We herein report a series of four neonates whose mothers had recovered from new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy.",

    "Intervention Serology and Interaction Substitution: Modeling the Role of \u2018Shield Immunity\u2019 in Reducing COVID-19 Epidemic Spread\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 confirmed deaths globally as of March 30, 2020 [1\u20134]. At present twOfficentral public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal",
    "A Case of COVID-19 Infection With Delayed Thromboembolic Complication on Warfarin\tNovel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to humanity with more than eight million infections and 450,000 deaths reported worldwide so far. The spectrum of the disease varies from mild asymptomatic infection to severe disease with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. It is associated with a prothrombotic state and hence there is a risk of thromboembolic complications in critically ill patients, even after recovery. However, the duration of prothrombotic risk after recovery is yet to be determined. We present the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin who had",
    "Laboratory findings that predict a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with diabetes: A meta-analysis\tDiabetes is one of the main comorbidities in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because the presence of diabetes and COVID-19 in the same patient is related to a poor clinical prognosis and a high probability of death, it is necessary to determine what findings allow us to predict a good or bad resolution of the disease in order to opt for a traditional treatment or a more incisive one. In this way, in the present work we analyze which laboratory parameters showed differences in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who",

We articulate opportunities to be seized, including increased comfort with technology and online platforms; stronger family and intergenerational connections, renewed energy to combat social isolation; more respect for self-care and time management; increased awareness about the importance of advance directives; and, potentially, increased interest across disciplines to work on issues of aging society. Ongoing efforts to improve policies and programs for longer, healthier lives might now be",

    "What are the functional results and complications from allograft reconstruction after partial hemipelvectomy of the pubis?\tBACKGROUND In patients undergoing hemipelvectomies including resection either of a portion of the pubis or the entire pubis from the symphysis to the lateral margin of the obturator foramen while sparing the hip (so-called Dunham Type III hemipelvectomies), reconstructions typically are not performed given the preserved continuity of the weightbearing axis and the potential complications associated with reconstruction. Allograft reconstruction of the pelvic ring may, however, offer benefits for soft tissue reconstruction of the pelvic floor and hip stability, but little is known about these reconstructions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) What is the postoperative functional status after allograft",
    "Behavioral Health and Response for COVID-19\tResearch from financial stress, disasters, pandemics, and other extreme events, suggests that behavioral health will suffer, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Furthermore, these symptoms are likely to exacerbate alcohol or drug use, especially for those vulnerable to relapse. The nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most",
