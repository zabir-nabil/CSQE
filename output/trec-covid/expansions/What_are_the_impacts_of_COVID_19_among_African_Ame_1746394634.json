    "The impacts of COVID-19 on African-Americans have been disproportionately higher compared to the rest of the U.S. population, revealing alarming disparities in health outcomes. Studies show that African-Americans are more likely to contract the virus due to factors such as higher rates of underlying health conditions, lower access to quality healthcare, and disparities in socioeconomic status. Additionally, African-Americans have faced higher mortality rates from COVID-19, with communities of color experiencing higher death rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups. These disparities highlight the systemic inequities in healthcare, social determinants of health, and structural racism that contribute to the unequal impact of the pandemic on African-American communities. It is imperative that healthcare systems and policymakers address these issues to ensure health equity and support the most vulnerable populations during these challenging times.",
    "COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on African-Americans compared to the rest of the U.S. population. Several factors have contributed to this disparity, including underlying health conditions, economic barriers, and systemic inequality. African-Americans are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, placing them at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Additionally, systemic racism has limited access to quality healthcare and resources in many African-American communities, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment for the virus. Economic disparities also play a role, as African-Americans are overrepresented in essential frontline jobs that increase their exposure to the virus. These combined factors have resulted in higher infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality among African-Americans during the pandemic, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions and support to address these disparities."

    "The impact of COVID-19 on African American communities in the United States\tIMPORTANCE: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. SETTING",
    "Racial segregation, testing sites access, and COVID-19 incidence rate in Massachusetts, USA\tThe U.S. has merely 4% of the world population but 25% of the world's COVID-19 cases. Massachusetts has been in the leading position of total cases since the outbreak in the U.S. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing sites access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables",

Suicidality in the middle of the COVID\u201019 pandemic\tOBJECTIVE: The current paper examines the intersection between social vulnerability, individual risk, and social/psychological resources with adult suicidality during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults.

    "Racial Disparity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in African American Communities\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled unsettling disparities in the outcome of the disease among African Americans. These disparities are not new, but are rooted in structural inequities that must be addressed to adequately care for communities of color. We describe the historical context of these structural inequities, their impact on the progression of COVID-19 in the African American (Black) community, and suggest a multifaceted approach to addressing these healthcare disparities. Of note, terminology from survey data cited for this article varied from Blacks, African Americans or both; for consistency, we use African Americans throughout.",
    "Differential expression of COVID-19-related genes in European Americans and African Americans\tThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected African American populations disproportionately in regards to both morbidity and mortality. A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the"
