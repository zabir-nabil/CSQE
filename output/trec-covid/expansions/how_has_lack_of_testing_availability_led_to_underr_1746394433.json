    "Due to the limited availability of testing for Covid-19, many individuals who may have been infected with the virus have not been able to get tested. This lack of testing availability has led to underreporting of the true incidence of Covid-19 in many communities. Without widespread testing, individuals who may be asymptomatic carriers or have mild symptoms may never know they are infected, leading to the potential spread of the virus unknowingly. Additionally, those who are unable to get tested due to constraints such as cost or accessibility may be contributing to the underreporting of cases. As a result, the true scope of the Covid-19 pandemic may be significantly underestimated due to the lack of testing availability.",
    "The lack of testing availability has significantly contributed to the underreporting of the true incidence of Covid-19. With limited access to testing, many individuals who are infected with the virus may not get tested or may face barriers in obtaining a test in a timely manner. This leads to a situation where the actual number of cases is much higher than what is officially reported. As a result, the true extent of the spread of the virus within communities and populations remains underestimated. Without comprehensive testing measures in place, it is challenging to accurately track and monitor the full scope of the pandemic, which can have serious implications for public health interventions and decision-making. In conclusion, the lack of testing availability hinders the ability to capture the true prevalence of Covid-19 and may contribute to underreporting of cases."

    "how has lack of testing availability led to underreporting of true incidence of Covid-19, Iran has been the hardest hit country by the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East with 74,877 confirmed cases and 4,683 deaths as of 15 April 2020. With a relatively high case fatality ratio and limited testing capacity, the number of confirmed cases reported is suspected to suffer from significant under-reporting. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and assessing the effectiveness of the interventions that have taken place in Iran while accounting for the uncertain level of underreporting is of critical importance. While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. This has not only facilitated community spread but has also resulted in an underestimation of the true incidence of the disease, a statistic which is useful for policy making aimed at controlling the current pandemic and in preparing for future outbreaks.",

    "Accounting for underreporting in mathematical modelling of transmission and control of COVID-19 in Iran\tBACKGROUND: Iran has been the hardest hit country by the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East with 74,877 confirmed cases and 4,683 deaths as of 15 April 2020. With a relatively high case fatality ratio and limited testing capacity, the number of confirmed cases reported is suspected to suffer from significant under-reporting. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and assessing the effectiveness of the interventions that have taken place in Iran while accounting for the uncertain level of underreporting is of critical importance. We use a mathematical epidemic model utilizing official confirmed data and estimates of underreporting to understand how transmission",

And are those who had mild cases of the disease\u2014perhaps so mild they dismissed it as a cold or allergies\u2014immune to new infections? If so, they could slow the spread of the burgeoning pandemic Labs and companies around the world have raced to develop antibody tests, and a few have been used in small studies and received commercial approval, including several from China But so far, large-scale data from such tests\u2014for example showing what fraction of people in the hard-hit city of Wuhan, China, might now be immune\u2014is",
    "Evaluating the massive underreporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in multiple global epicenters\tAbstract Background With continuous global COVID-19 outbreak, differing case numbers and mortality rates are observed. While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. Methods We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan",

    "Changes in testing rates could mask the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) growth rate\tSince the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history. Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies. Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0. Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the",

    "Bounding the Predictive Values of COVID-19 Antibody Tests\tCOVID-19 antibody tests have imperfect accuracy. There has been lack of clarity on the meaning of reported rates of false positives and false negatives. For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a",
    "Identifying a Kidney Transplant Recipient COVID Phenotype to Aid Test Utilization in the Setting of Limited Testing Availability - Does One Exist?\tAbstract: The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in immunocompetent patients raises significant concern for immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). This level of concern, both on the part of the KTRs and transplant professionals, is heightened by a lack of prior knowledge on how SARS-CoV-2 may manifest differently in immunosuppressed patients. Characterizing how KTRs may present differently than the general population would allow for more targeted and timely evaluation and treatment of KTRs with COVID-19 infection. Methods Without prior knowledge of how this virus would affect our transplant center\u2019s delivery of care to",
    "Hyperlocal Postcode Based Crowdsourced Surveillance Systems in the COVID-19 Pandemic Response\tThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly saturated healthcare resources across the globe and has led to a restricted screening process, hindering efforts at comprehensive case detection. This has not only facilitated community spread but has also resulted in an underestimation of the true incidence of disease, a statistic which is useful for policy making aimed at controlling the current pandemic and in preparing for future outbreaks. In this perspective, we present a crowdsourced platform developed by us for the true estimation of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community, through active self-reporting and layering other authentic datasets. The granularity of data captured by this system",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that causes disease in humans. THE PROBLEM Despite the established role of molecular diagnostics, COVID-19 serodiagnosis remains a poorly discovered and enigmatic area. Although there are numerous commercial serological products available globally, there is a severe paucity of high-quality peer-reviewed literature on their true performance characteristics.
