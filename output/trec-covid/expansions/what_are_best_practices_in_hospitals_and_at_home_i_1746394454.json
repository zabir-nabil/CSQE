Implementing strict hygiene protocols, including regular handwashing and disinfection of surfaces in quarantine areas.\n4. Monitoring individuals in quarantine for symptoms and providing medical care as needed.\n5. Limiting the number of visitors and ensuring they follow safety protocols when interacting with quarantined individuals.\n6. Educating patients and their families on quarantine guidelines and the importance of compliance.\n7. At home, individuals should self-isolate in a separate room with access to a separate bathroom if possible.\n8. Avoiding close contact with household members and pets, and following proper hygiene practices.\n9. Regularly disinfecting commonly touched surfaces and washing laundry and dishes at a high temperature.\n10. Following healthcare provider instructions for monitoring symptoms and seeking medical help if symptoms worsen.\n\nBy following these best practices, hospitals and individuals can effectively maintain quarantine protocols to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect the health and safety of others.",
    "Maintaining quarantine is crucial in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, both in hospitals and at home. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\nIn hospitals:\n1. Implement strict protocols: Hospitals should have clear guidelines on quarantine procedures, including isolation areas, personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, and disinfection protocols.\n2. Regular monitoring: Healthcare workers should regularly monitor quarantined individuals for symptoms, and promptly notify medical staff if any issues arise.\n3. Communication: Clear and open communication is essential to ensure all staff members understand the importance of maintaining quarantine measures and adhere to the protocols in place.\n4. Training: Provide training to healthcare workers on proper quarantine procedures, including how to safely handle and dispose of contaminated materials.\n5. Support systems: Offer support services such as counseling for patients in quarantine to help them cope with isolation and reduce stress.\n\nAt home:\n1. Designate a quarantine area: Set up a separate room or space in the home for the quarantined person to stay, with their own dedicated bathroom if possible.\n2. Limit contact: Minimize contact with the quarantined individual and have them use a separate set of utensils, dishes, and personal items to prevent the spread of germs.\n3. Regular cleaning: Thoroughly disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops, in the quarantine area and throughout the home.\n4. Personal protective equipment: If providing care to the quarantined person, wear appropriate PPE such as masks and gloves, and dispose of them properly after use.\n5. Follow medical advice: Ensure the quarantined individual follows any medical advice provided by healthcare professionals, such as taking medications or monitoring symptoms.\n\nBy following these best practices, hospitals and individuals can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect the health and safety of others."

    "Impact of Home Quarantine on Physical Activity Among Older Adults Living at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Interview Study\tBACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical",

Following extensive consultation, they were first published in January 2001 1 and updated in 2007. 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective for",
    "Best Practices for Healthcare Facility and Regional Stockpile Maintenance and Sustainment: A Literature Review.\tPreparing for mass casualty incidents is essential to maximizing community resilience. Many US-based organizations and regions have developed stockpiles of medications, supplies, and equipment for mass casualty incident preparedness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assess and manage federally stockpiled materials, but hospitals, healthcare systems, and regional organizations are responsible for maintaining locally owned caches. The CDC has protocols for assessing and managing the Strategic National Stockpile, but no such guidance exists for local or geographical/regional stockpiles.
