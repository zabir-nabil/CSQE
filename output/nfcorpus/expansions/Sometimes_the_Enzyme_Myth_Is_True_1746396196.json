    "In the world of biology and biochemistry, enzymes play a vital role in facilitating chemical reactions within living organisms. Enzymes are known for their ability to greatly speed up these reactions, often making them essential for life. However, there are instances where misconceptions about enzymes can arise, leading to what has been coined as the \"Enzyme Myth.\"\n\nThe Enzyme Myth refers to the misconception that enzymes are always perfect and infallible in their actions. While enzymes are highly efficient catalysts, capable of accelerating reactions by many orders of magnitude, they are not immune to errors or variations in their function. Factors such as pH, temperature, and the presence of inhibitors can all affect the performance of enzymes, leading to the potential for errors or inefficiencies in their catalytic activity.\n\nDespite this, it is essential to recognize that the Enzyme Myth is not entirely false. Enzymes are remarkable biological molecules that have evolved to perform specific functions with incredible precision and efficiency. In many cases, the reactivity and specificity of enzymes are indeed remarkable, allowing them to carry out essential processes in living organisms with extraordinary accuracy.\n\nTherefore, while the Enzyme Myth may occasionally hold true in certain contexts, it is essential to appreciate the complexity and versatility of enzymes as dynamic biological catalysts. By understanding both the capabilities and limitations of enzymes, scientists can continue to unlock the vast potential of these remarkable molecules in advancing our knowledge of biochemistry and enhancing various industrial and medical applications.",
    "The statement \"Sometimes the Enzyme Myth Is True\" suggests that there are instances where misconceptions or myths about enzymes can actually turn out to be accurate. Enzymes are biological molecules that act as catalysts to speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. While enzymes are typically associated with their specificity and efficiency in facilitating biochemical processes, there may be occasions where misconceptions or misunderstandings about their function actually align with reality.\n\nOne possible scenario where the \"Enzyme Myth\" could be true is in cases involving atypical enzymes or unusual biochemical pathways. These unique enzymes may exhibit unconventional properties or functions that challenge traditional understanding, leading to myths or misconceptions that, upon further investigation, may prove to be grounded in truth.\n\nMoreover, the complexity of enzyme interactions within biological systems can sometimes give rise to apparently mythological or mysterious characteristics. Over time, advances in scientific research and technology can uncover hidden truths or nuances about enzyme activities, shedding light on previously misunderstood aspects of their function.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of the \"Enzyme Myth\" may initially seem contradictory to established scientific knowledge, there are circumstances where such myths may hold a kernel of truth. By delving deeper into the complexities of enzyme biology and exploring unconventional enzyme behaviors, we may uncover new insights that challenge our preconceptions and expand our understanding of these essential biological molecules."

    "Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity\tBACKGROUND Many beliefs about obesity persist in the absence of supporting scientific evidence (presumptions); some persist despite contradicting evidence (myths). The promulgation of unsupported beliefs may yield poorly informed policy decisions, inaccurate clinical and public health recommendations, and an unproductive allocation of research resources and may divert attention away from useful, evidence-based information. METHODS Using Internet searches of popular media and scientific literature, we identified, reviewed, and classified obesity-related myths and presumptions. We also examined facts that are well supported by evidence, with an emphasis on those that have practical implications for public health, policy, or clinical recommendations",
    "Fostering antioxidant defences: up-regulation of antioxidant genes or antioxidant supplementation?\tVitamins have traditionally been considered as food components that are required in the normal diet to prevent deficiencies. However, a newer concept of the function of vitamins in nutrition has taken them beyond simply prevention of deficiency symptoms. This concept considers that many vitamins, when taken in relatively large doses, have important functions beyond preventing deficiencies. Linus Pauling was instrumental in putting forward this concept, particularly for vitamin C. Thus, relatively high intakes of vitamins, and in particular vitamins C and E which are antioxidants, are considered to be healthy for the human population. This may be true in some special situations",
    "Monosodium glutamate 'allergy': menace or myth?\tMonosodium glutamate (MSG) is a salt form of a non-essential amino acid commonly used as a food additive for its unique flavour enhancing qualities. Since the first description of the 'Monosodium glutamate symptom complex', originally described in 1968 as the 'Chinese restaurant syndrome', a number of anecdotal reports and small clinical studies of variable quality have attributed a variety of symptoms to the dietary ingestion of MSG. Descriptions of MSG-induced asthma, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis have prompted some to suggest that MSG should be an aetiologic consideration in patients presenting with these conditions. This review prevents a",
    "Longevity and diet. Myth or pragmatism?\tLongevity is a very complex phenomenon, because many environmental, behavioral, socio-demographic and dietary factors influence the physiological pathways of aging and life-expectancy. Nutrition has been recognized to have an important impact on overall mortality and morbidity; and its role in extending life expectancy has been the object of extensive scientific research. This paper reviews the pathophysiological mechanisms that potentially link aging with diet and the scientific evidence supporting the anti-aging effect of the traditional Mediterranean diet, as well as of some specific foods. The diet and several of its components have additionally been shown to have beneficial effects on the co-morbidities typical of",
    "Oligo-antigenic diet in the treatment of chronic anal fissures. Evidence for a relationship between food hypersensitivity and anal fissures.\tOBJECTIVES: Patients with chronic constipation due to food hypersensitivity (FH) had an elevated anal sphincter resting pressure. No studies have investigated a possible role of FH in anal fissures (AFs). We aimed to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of diet in curing AFs and to evaluate (2) the clinical effects of a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge, using cow's milk protein or wheat. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with AFs were randomized to receive a \"true-elimination diet\" or",

    "Milk Intake and Total Dairy Consumption: Associations with Early Menarche in NHANES 1999-2004\tBackground Several components of dairy products have been linked to earlier menarche. Methods/Findings This study assessed whether positive associations exist between childhood milk consumption and age at menarche or the likelihood of early menarche (<12 yrs) in a U.S sample. Data derive from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u20132004. Two samples were utilized: 2657 women age 20\u201349 yrs and 1008 girls age 9\u201312 yrs.

    "Mitigation strategies to reduce acrylamide formation in fried potato products.\tPotato products contain high amounts of acrylamide, which sometimes exceeds the concentration of 1 mg/L. However, many strategies for acrylamide reduction in potato products are possible. In this work, the different approaches for reducing acrylamide formation have been reviewed, keeping in mind that in the application of strategies for acrylamide formation, the main criteria to be maintained are the overall organoleptic and nutritional qualities of the final product."
