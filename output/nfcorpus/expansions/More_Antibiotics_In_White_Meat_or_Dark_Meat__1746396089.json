  "keqe_expansions": [
    "When it comes to the question of whether there are more antibiotics in white meat or dark meat, it's important to consider how antibiotics are used in the poultry industry. Antibiotics are commonly added to poultry feed or water to promote growth and prevent diseases in crowded and stressful farm conditions. Both white meat (such as chicken breast) and dark meat (such as chicken thighs) come from the same bird, so the antibiotic levels should theoretically be similar in both types of meat. However, antibiotics can accumulate in certain tissues of the animal more than others, depending on the specific drug and the metabolism of the bird. Therefore, it is possible that some studies may find slightly higher levels of antibiotics in one type of meat over the other. Overall, consumers concerned about antibiotic use in poultry should seek out products that are labeled as \"antibiotic-free\" or \"raised without antibiotics\" to make more informed choices about the meat they consume.",
    "When it comes to antibiotics in white meat versus dark meat, it is important to consider the practices of the poultry industry. Antibiotics are commonly used in poultry farming to promote growth and prevent diseases in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. However, the use of antibiotics can vary between white and dark meat depending on the production methods employed by farmers.\n\nIn general, white meat such as chicken breasts tend to have a higher antibiotic content compared to dark meat like chicken thighs. This is because white meat is more popular and in greater demand, leading to a higher concentration of antibiotics being used in white meat production to meet consumer needs and production demands.\n\nOn the other hand, dark meat is often sourced from different parts of the poultry and may not be subjected to the same level of antibiotic use as white meat. Additionally, dark meat is less preferred by consumers compared to white meat, which could also contribute to lower antibiotic usage in dark meat production.\n\nUltimately, while both white and dark meat may contain traces of antibiotics due to farming practices, white meat is more likely to have a higher concentration of antibiotics compared to dark meat. It is important for consumers to be aware of these differences when making decisions about their meat consumption and to opt for antibiotic-free or organic options whenever possible to minimize health risks."

    "We sought to characterize the arsenic species profile in chicken meat and estimate bladder and lung cancer risk associated with consuming chicken produced with arsenic-based drugs. Determine the relations of red, white and processed meat intakes to risk for total, and cause-specific mortality. High temperature cooking methods such as grilling and barbecuing may produce heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are known carcinogens. Higher intakes of dark fish may prevent sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias."

    "Dietary risk factors for colon cancer in a low-risk population.\tIn a 6-year prospective study, the authors examined the relation between diet and incident colon cancer among 32,051 non-Hispanic white cohort members of the Adventist Health Study (California, 1976-1982) who, at baseline, had no documented or reported history of cancer. The risk of colon cancer was determined from proportional hazards regression with adjustment for age and other covariates. The authors found a positive association with total meat intake (risk ratio (RR) for > or =1 time/week vs. no meat intake = 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-2.87;",
    "Dioxins, dibenzofurans, dioxin-like PCBs, and DDE in U.S. fast food, 1995.\tFood, especially dairy products, meat, and fish, is the primary source of environmental exposure to dioxins in the general population. Little data exists on dioxin levels in the popular and widely consumed \"fast foods\". Data presented in a previously published pilot study was limited to measuring only the levels of dioxins and dibenzofurans in three types of U.S. fast food. This study adds to the previous paper by presenting data, in addition to dioxins and dibenzofurans, on the closely related dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the persistent metabolite of DDT, 1,1-",
    "Roxarsone, Inorganic Arsenic, and Other Arsenic Species in Chicken: A U.S.-Based Market Basket Sample\tBackground: Inorganic arsenic (iAs) causes cancer and possibly other adverse health outcomes. Arsenic-based drugs are permitted in poultry production; however, the contribution of chicken consumption to iAs intake is unknown. Objectives: We sought to characterize the arsenic species profile in chicken meat and estimate bladder and lung cancer risk associated with consuming chicken produced with arsenic-based drugs. Methods: Conventional, antibiotic-free, and organic chicken samples were collected from grocery stores in 10 U.S. metropolitan areas from December 2010 through June 2011. We tested 116 raw and 142 cooked chicken samples for total",
    "Meat intake and mortality: a prospective study of over half a million people\tContext High intakes of red or processed meat may increase risk of mortality. Objective Determine the relations of red, white and processed meat intakes to risk for total, and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort of half a million people aged 50-71 years at baseline. Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the models were: age; education",
    "Meat consumption, Cooking Practices, Meat Mutagens and Risk of Prostate Cancer\tConsumption of red meat, particularly well done meat, has been associated with increased prostate cancer risk. High temperature cooking methods such as grilling and barbequeing may produce heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are known carcinogens. We assessed the association with meat consumption and estimated HCA and PAH exposure in a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer. Newly diagnosed cases aged 40\u201379 years (531 advanced cases, 195 localized cases) and 527 controls were asked about dietary intake, including usual meat cooking methods and doneness levels. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%",
    "Bacteriophage biocontrol in animals and meat products\tSummary Since their discovery almost a century ago, bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or \u2018phages\u2019) have been used to prevent and treat a multitude of bacterial infections (phage therapy: PT). In addition, they have been the basis for many advances in genetics and biochemistry. Phage therapy was performed on human subjects in the United States, Europe and Asia in the few decades following their discovery. However, Western countries largely abandoned PT in favour of antibiotics in the 1940s. The relatively recent renaissance of PT in the West can be attributed partly to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human and animal pathogens. However, the",
    "Fruit, vegetable, and fish consumption and heart rate variability: the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study\tBackground: Higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, and dark fish may prevent sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias, but the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Objective: We examined whether high consumption of fruit, vegetables, and dark fish would be associated with beneficial changes in heart rate variability (HRV). Design: HRV variables were measured among 586 older men with 928 total observations from November 2000 to June 2007 in the Normative Aging Study, a community-based longitudinal study of aging. Dietary intake was evaluated with a self-administered semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire and categorized",
    "Effects of low habitual cocoa intake on blood pressure and bioactive nitric oxide: a randomized controlled trial.\tCONTEXT: Regular intake of cocoa-containing foods is linked to lower cardiovascular mortality in observational studies. Short-term interventions of at most 2 weeks indicate that high doses of cocoa can improve endothelial function and reduce blood pressure (BP) due to the action of the cocoa polyphenols, but the clinical effect of low habitual cocoa intake on BP and the underlying BP-lowering mechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of low doses of polyphenol-rich dark chocolate on BP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel",
    "Dietary habits and past medical history as related to fatal pancreas cancer risk among Adventists.\tEpidemiologic studies of diet and pancreas cancer are few, and include ecologic comparisons and a limited number of prospective and case-control studies. Foods and/or nutrients that have been suggested to be associated with increased risk of this cancer include total fat intake, eggs, animal protein, sugar, meat, coffee and butter. Consumption of raw fruits and vegetables has been consistently associated with decreased risk. Dietary habits and medical history variables were evaluated in a prospective study of fatal pancreas cancer among 34,000 California Seventh-day Adventists between 1976 and 1983. Forty deaths from pancreas cancer occurred during the follow",
    "Does a vegetarian diet reduce the occurrence of diabetes?\tWe propose the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of developing diabetes. Findings that have generated this hypothesis are from a population of 25,698 adult White Seventh-day Adventists identified in 1960. During 21 years of follow-up, the risk of diabetes as an underlying cause of death in Adventists was approximately one-half the risk for all US Whites. Within the male Adventist population, vegetarians had a substantially lower risk than non-vegetarians of diabetes as an underlying or contributing cause of death. Within both the male and female Adventist populations, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes also was lower in vegetarians"
