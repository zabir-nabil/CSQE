    "Researchers have been investigating the potential link between titanium dioxide and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Titanium dioxide is a common food additive used to brighten and whiten various products. Some studies suggest that titanium dioxide nanoparticles, which are tiny particles found in certain foods and medications, may be able to pass through the gut barrier and potentially trigger an immune response leading to inflammation in the bowels. This inflammation could contribute to the development or exacerbation of IBD, a chronic inflammatory condition of the digestive system. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between titanium dioxide exposure and IBD. It is important for individuals with IBD to discuss their concerns with a healthcare provider and consider monitoring their intake of products containing titanium dioxide.",
    "Current research suggests that there may be a correlation between titanium dioxide and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Titanium dioxide, a widely used food additive and ingredient in various consumer products, has been linked to intestinal inflammation and disruption of the gut microbiota. This disruption can exacerbate inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The mechanism by which titanium dioxide triggers or worsens IBD is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to involve the immune system's response to the particles in the gastrointestinal tract. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between titanium dioxide exposure and the development or progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In the meantime, individuals with IBD may consider limiting their consumption of products containing titanium dioxide as a precautionary measure."

    "Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.\tBACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated",
    "Immune potentiation of ultrafine dietary particles in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\tVarious specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters",
    "Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles in Food and Personal Care Products\tTitanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system, and subsequently enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids. This study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products, derives estimates of human exposure to dietary (nano-) TiO2, and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of TiO2 entering the environment. The foods with the highest content of TiO2 included candies, sweets and chewing gums. Among personal care products, toothpastes and select",
    "Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of the gastrointestinal tract\tDietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (1012) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which",
    "Dietary sources of inorganic microparticles and their intake in healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's disease.\tDietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general",
    "Evaluation of certain food additives. Seventy-first report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.\tThis report represents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, with a view to recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to preparing specifications for identity and purity. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation and assessment of intake of food additives. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of technical, toxicological and intake data for certain food additives: branching glycosyltransferase from Rhodothermus obamensis expressed in Bacillus subtilis, cassia gum, cyclamic acid and its",
    "Inflammatory bowel disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa: rarity of diagnosis in patients attending mission hospitals.\tOne hundred and eighteen missionaries working on 75 mission stations or hospitals in 24 sub-Saharan African countries provided information about their medical practice in the preceding year of 1981. Details were collected of the total number of patients seen and admitted during the year, and the number of cases of bloody diarrhoea, typhoid and inflammatory bowel disease. Over 1 million outpatients and about 190,000 inpatients were treated. These included 12,859 cases of bloody diarrhoea, of whom 1,914 had typhoid. Twenty-two cases of inflammatory bowel disease were also reported. Histological support was least available in West Africa",
    "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor in inflammatory bowel disease: linking the environment to disease pathogenesis.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by a large number of environmental agents, modulates the activity of immune and nonimmune cells in the gut, and may represent an important link between the environment and the immune perturbations which underlie the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review will summarize the current knowledge of the role of AhR in regulation of intestinal immune homeostasis and inflammation. RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of AhR by dietary ligands is necessary for the maintenance or expansion of innate immune cells in the gut, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and",
    "Asthma induced by sulphur dioxide, benzoate and tartrazine contained in orange drinks.\tOf 272 patients with asthma, thirty (11%) gave a history of exacerbations occurring after ingestion, solutions of orange orange drinks. Fourteen of these were given provocation tests by drinking, on separate occasions of sulphur dioxide, sodium benzoate and tartrazine, which are present in all orange drinks. Eight reacted to sulphur dioxide with a fall in FEV1, four to sodium benzoate and one to tartrazine, and four did not react to any of these agents. Three of the benzoate patients were also sensitive to sulphur dioxide. The sulphur dioxide sensitive patients were predominantly young, with extrinsic asthma. The",
