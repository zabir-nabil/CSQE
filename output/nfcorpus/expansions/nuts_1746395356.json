    "nuts Nuts are an important source of many vitamins, minerals, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This paper reviewed all the available evidence from the literature in relation to nut consumption and body weight. Nut consumption seems to protect against ischemic heart disease (IHD). Nuts also constitute an important part of other plant-based diets, such as Mediterranean and Asian diets. Nut consumption has been associated with several health benefits, such as antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, cardioprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits. The recent recognition of nuts as 'heart-healthy' foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given a major boost to the positive image of nuts. The aim of the present article is to describe the most important historical and cultural aspects of nut consumption throughout history. Particular emphasis is placed on the healthy and nutritional attributes that nuts have had throughout history. Increased nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined the association between nut consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality.",

    "A review of the evidence: nuts and body weight.\tThere is currently no single dietary or lifestyle intervention that is effective in long-term weight loss. Traditional weight loss diets tend to be low in total fat and therefore often restrict nut consumption. However, nuts are an important source of many vitamins, minerals, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This paper reviewed all the available evidence from the literature in relation to nut consumption and body weight. The findings show that the role of nut consumption in body weight management is varied. Nuts, when included as part of an energy-controlled diet, were found in some instances to assist with weight loss. However",
    "Nut consumption is associated with decreased health risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome in U.S. adults: NHANES 1999-2004.\tBACKGROUND: Few recent epidemiologic studies have assessed the effect that nut consumption (including tree nuts and peanuts) has on health risks, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). OBJECTIVE: This study compared the health risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and MetS of nut consumers with that of nonconsumers. DESIGN: Adults 19+ years (n = 13,292) participating in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. Intake from 24-hour recalls was used to determine intake. Nut/tree nut consumers consumed \u2265\u00bc",
    "Nut consumption, vegetarian diets, ischemic heart disease risk, and all-cause mortality: evidence from epidemiologic studies.\tPerhaps one of the most unexpected and novel findings in nutritional epidemiology in the past 5 y has been that nut consumption seems to protect against ischemic heart disease (IHD). Frequency and quantity of nut consumption have been documented to be higher in vegetarian than in nonvegetarian populations. Nuts also constitute an important part of other plant-based diets, such as Mediterranean and Asian diets. In a large, prospective epidemiologic study of Seventh-day Adventists in California, we found that frequency of nut consumption had a substantial and highly significant inverse association with risk of",
    "Health benefits of nut consumption with special reference to body weight control.\tNuts are an integral part of the Mediterranean food patterns, and their incorporation into the regular diets of human beings is believed to provide many health benefits. The recent recognition of nuts as \"heart-healthy\" foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given a major boost to the positive image of nuts. Nut consumption has been associated with several health benefits, such as antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, cardioprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits, among other functional properties. However, although nuts possess these many health benefits, their consumption has been hampered by a lack of adequate information",
    "Prospective study of nut consumption, long-term weight change, and obesity risk in women\tBackground: Data concerning the long-term association between nut consumption and weight change in a free-living population are sparse. Objective: The objective was to determine the relation between nut consumption and long-term weight change. Design: The participants were 51,188 women in the Nurses' Health Study II aged 20\u201345 y, who had no cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. We prospectively evaluated the dietary intake of nuts and subsequent weight changes from 1991 to 1999. Results: Women who reported eating nuts \u22652 times/wk had slightly less mean (\u00b1 SE) weight gain",
    "Association between betel-nut chewing and chronic kidney disease in men.\tBACKGROUND: Betel-nut use is associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. However, the association between betel-nut chewing and risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. The present study was conducted to determine the association between betel-nut chewing and CKD in men. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed health-check records of 3264 men in a hospital-based cross-sectional screening programme from 2003 to 2006. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Risk factors for CKD including diabetes,",
    "Frequency of nut consumption and mortality risk in the PREDIMED nutrition intervention trial\tBackground Prospective studies in non-Mediterranean populations have consistently related increasing nut consumption to lower coronary heart disease mortality. A small protective effect on all-cause and cancer mortality has also been suggested. To examine the association between frequency of nut consumption and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk from Spain, a Mediterranean country with a relatively high average nut intake per person. Methods We evaluated 7,216 men and women aged 55 to 80 years randomized to 1 of 3 interventions (Mediterranean diets supplemented with nuts or olive oil and control diet) in the PREDIMED (\u2018PREvenci\u00f3n con DIeta MEDiterr\u00e1nea\u2019) study.",
    "Nut consumption and blood lipid levels: a pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials.\tBACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have consistently associated nut consumption with reduced risk for coronary heart disease. Subsequently, many dietary intervention trials investigated the effects of nut consumption on blood lipid levels. The objectives of this study were to estimate the effects of nut consumption on blood lipid levels and to examine whether different factors modify the effects. METHODS: We pooled individual primary data from 25 nut consumption trials conducted in 7 countries among 583 men and women with normolipidemia and hypercholesterolemia who were not taking lipid-lowering medications. In a pooled analysis, we used mixed linear models to assess the effects of nut consumption",
    "Cultural and historical aspects of Mediterranean nuts with emphasis on their attributed healthy and nutritional properties.\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nuts have been part of the human diet since prehistoric times. The aim of the present article is to describe the most important historical and cultural aspects of nut consumption throughout history. DATA SYNTHESIS: We discuss the following historical aspects of nuts originating in the Mediterranean: prehistory, the Egyptian civilization, their spread through the Mediterranean region by the Greek, Phoenician and Roman civilizations, and their reintroduction into Europe by means of the Al-Andalus culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the healthy and nutritional attributes that nuts have had throughout history. We also consider the",
    "Association of Nut Consumption with Total and Cause-Specific Mortality\tBACKGROUND Increased nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the association between nut consumption and mortality remains unclear. METHODS We examined the association between nut consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 76,464 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (1980\u20132010) and 42,498 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986\u20132010).
