    "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, emotions, sleep, and appetite. It is often referred to as the \"feel-good\" neurotransmitter because of its ability to promote feelings of well-being and happiness. Serotonin also helps to control various bodily functions, such as digestion and blood clotting. Imbalances in serotonin levels have been associated with conditions like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Increasing serotonin levels through lifestyle changes, medications, or therapy can help improve mood and overall well-being.",
    "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and memory. It is often referred to as the \"feel-good\" chemical because higher levels of serotonin are associated with feelings of well-being and happiness. Imbalances in serotonin levels can lead to various mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Serotonin is produced in the brain and is influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, and exposure to sunlight. Medications like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are commonly prescribed to help regulate serotonin levels and improve symptoms of mood disorders. Overall, serotonin is a vital chemical messenger that influences our emotional state and overall mental health."

    "serotonin Melatonin is a neurohormone produced by the pineal gland of animals. Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter and one of the precursors of melatonin biosynthesis. Consuming foodstuffs containing melatonin and serotonin could raise their physiologic concentrations in blood and enhance human health. Biogenic monoamines such as serotonin, tryptamine, and tyramine function as neurotransmitters and mitogenic factors in animals and are involved in flowering, morphogenesis, and protection from and adaptation to environmental changes in plants. In plants, serotonin and tyramine are conjugated to form phenolic compounds via thioester linkages during the synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acid amides. When plasma tryptophan is elevated by the injection of tryptophan or insulin, or by the consumption of carbohydrates, brain tryptophan and serotonin also rise. An analytical method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of serotonin, melatonin, trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS).

    "Application of LC and LC-MS to the analysis of melatonin and serotonin in edible plants.\tMelatonin is a neurohormone produced by the pineal gland of animals. Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter and one of the precursors of melatonin biosynthesis. These two indoleamines have recently been reported to have widespread occurrence in many edible plants. Consuming foodstuffs containing melatonin and serotonin could raise their physiologic concentrations in blood and enhance human health. Literature concerning analytical methods suitable for determination of melatonin and serotonin in edible plants is limited, although several liquid chromatographic (LC) techniques have been used for their quantification.

    "Brain serotonin content: physiological regulation by plasma neutral amino acids.\tWhen plasma tryptophan is elevated by the injection of tryptophan or insulin, or by the consumption of carbohydrates, brain tryptophan and serotonin also rise; however, when even larger elevations of plasma tryptophan are produced by the ingestion of protein-containing diets, brain tryptophan and serotonin do not change. The main determinant of brain tryptophan and serotonin concentrations does not appear to be plasma tryptophan alone, but the ratio of this amino acid to other plasma neutral amino acids (that is, tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine) that compete with it for uptake into the brain.",
    "Simultaneous analysis of serotonin, melatonin, piceid and resveratrol in fruits using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.\tAn analytical method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of serotonin, melatonin, trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative ionization modes.

    "Antidepressants and the Placebo Effect\tAntidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect. Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most",
    "Primum Non Nocere: An Evolutionary Analysis of Whether Antidepressants Do More Harm than Good\tAntidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin \u2013 an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals, and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health",

    "Monoaminergic neurotransmission: the history of the discovery of antidepressants from 1950s until today.\tThe 1950s saw the clinical introduction of the first two specifically antidepressant drugs: iproniazid, a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor that had been used in the treatment of tuberculosis, and imipramine, the first drug in the tricyclic antidepressant family. Iproniazid and imipramine made two fundamental contributions to the development of psychiatry: one of a social-health nature, consisting in an authentic change in the psychiatric care of depressive patients; and the other of a purely pharmacological nature, since these agents have constituted an indispensable research tool for neurobiology and psychopharmacology, permitting, among other things, the postulation of the first aetiopathogenic"
