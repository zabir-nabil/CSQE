    "Bone fractures occur when a bone in the body is damaged and breaks. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as high impact from a fall or accident, repetitive stress, or weakening of the bones due to conditions like osteoporosis. When a bone fractures, it can cause pain, swelling, and a decreased range of motion in the affected area. Treatment for bone fractures typically involves immobilizing the affected bone with a splint or cast to allow it to heal properly. In some cases, surgery may be required to realign the bones and stabilize the fracture. Recovery time for a bone fracture can vary depending on the severity of the injury and individual healing factors. It is important to follow the advice of a healthcare professional to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.",
    "A bone fracture occurs when the integrity of a bone is compromised, leading to a break or crack in the bone structure. Fractures can be caused by various factors, such as trauma from falls, accidents, or repetitive stress on the bone. There are different types of fractures, including closed fractures where the bone breaks but does not pierce the skin, and open fractures where the bone protrudes through the skin. Treatment for bone fractures usually involves immobilizing the affected area with a cast or splint to allow the bone to heal properly. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to realign the bone fragments and stabilize the fracture. It is important to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect a bone fracture to prevent further complications and promote a faster recovery."

    "Protective effect of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (phytate) on bone mass loss in postmenopausal women.\tINTRODUCTION: The objective of this paper was to evaluate the relationship between urinary concentrations of InsP6, bone mass loss and risk fracture in postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 157 postmenopausal women were included in the study: 70 had low (\u22640.76 \u03bcM), 42 intermediate (0.76-1.42 \u03bcM) and 45 high (\u22651.42 \u03bcM) urinary phytate concentrations. Densitometry values for neck were measured at enrollment and after 12 months (lumbar spine and femoral neck), and 10-year risk fracture was calculated using the tool FRAX(\u00ae). RESULTS:",
    "Dietary protein and bone health: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\tBACKGROUND: There has been a resurgence of interest in the controversial relation between dietary protein and bone health. OBJECTIVE: This article reports on the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the relation between protein and bone health in healthy human adults. DESIGN: The MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to July 2008) databases were electronically searched for all relevant studies of healthy adults; studies of calcium excretion or calcium balance were excluded. RESULTS: In cross-sectional surveys, all pooled r values for the relation between protein intake and bone mineral density (BMD)",
    "Skeletal health in adult patients with classic galactosemia.\tSUMMARY: This study evaluated bone health in adults with galactosemia. Associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutritional and biochemical variables were explored. Calcium level predicted hip and spine BMD, and gonadotropin levels were inversely associated with spinal BMD in women. These results afford insights into management strategies for these patients. INTRODUCTION: Bone loss is a complication of galactosemia. Dietary restriction, primary ovarian insufficiency in women, and disease-related alterations of bone metabolism may contribute. This study examined relationships between clinical factors and BMD in patients with galactosemia. METHODS: This cross-sectional sample included 33 adults (16 women) with",
    "Milk intake and risk of hip fracture in men and women: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\tMilk contains calcium, phosphorus, and protein and is fortified with vitamin D in the United States. All these ingredients may improve bone health. However, the potential benefit of milk on hip fracture prevention is not well established. The objective of this study was to assess the association of milk intake with risk of hip fracture based on a meta-analysis of cohort studies in middle-aged or older men and women. Data sources for this study were English and non-English publications via Medline (Ovid, PubMed) and EMBASE search up to June 2010",
    "Milk Consumption During Teenage Years and Risk of Hip Fractures in Older Adults\tImportance Milk consumption during adolescence is recommended to promote peak bone mass and thereby reduce fracture risk in later life. However, its role in hip fracture prevention is not established and high consumption may adversely influence risk by increasing height. Objective To determine whether milk consumption during teenage years influences risk of hip fracture in older adults and to investigate the role of attained height in this association. Design Prospective cohort study over 22 years of follow-up Setting United States Participants Over 96,000 Caucasian postmenopausal women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and men age 50 and older from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study Exposures Frequency",

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of self-reported fracture risk at follow-up. SETTING: The United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: A total of 7947 men and 26,749 women aged 20-89 years, including 19,249 meat eaters, 4901 fish eaters, 9420 vegetarians and 1126 vegans, recruited by postal methods and through general practice surgeries.

    "Low protein intake: the impact on calcium and bone homeostasis in humans.\tIncreasing dietary protein results in an increase in urinary calcium. Despite over 80 y of research, the source of the additional urinary calcium remains unclear. Because most calcium balance studies found little effect of dietary protein on intestinal calcium absorption, it was assumed that the skeleton was the source of the calcium. The hypothesis was that the high endogenous acid load generated by a protein-rich diet would increase bone resorption and skeletal fracture. However, there are no definitive nutrition intervention studies that show a detrimental effect of a high protein diet on the skeleton and the hypothesis remains unproven. Recent studies from our",
    "Protein intake, calcium balance and health consequences.\tHigh-protein (HP) diets exert a hypercalciuric effect at constant levels of calcium intake, even though the effect may depend on the nature of the dietary protein. Lower urinary pH is also consistently observed for subjects consuming HP diets. The combination of these two effects was suspected to be associated with a dietary environment favorable for demineralization of the skeleton. However, increased calcium excretion due to HP diet does not seem to be linked to impaired calcium balance. In contrast, some data indicate that HP intakes induce an increase of intestinal calcium absorption. Moreover, no clinical data support the hypothesis of a detrimental effect of HP",
    "Calcium supplementation and bone mineral density in females from childhood to young adulthood: a randomized controlled trial.\tBACKGROUND: Short-term studies established that calcium influences bone accretion during growth. Whether long-term supplementation influences bone accretion in young adults is not known. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the long-term effects of calcium supplementation on bone accretion among females from childhood to young adulthood. DESIGN: A 4-y randomized clinical trial recruited 354 females in pubertal stage 2 and optionally was extended for an additional 3 y. The mean dietary calcium intake of the participants over 7 y was approximately 830 mg/d; calcium-supplemented persons received an additional approximately 670 mg/",
    "Effects of habitual coffee consumption on cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular health, and all-cause mortality.\tCoffee, after water, is the most widely consumed beverage in the United States, and is the principal source of caffeine intake among adults. The biological effects of coffee may be substantial and are not limited to the actions of caffeine. Coffee is a complex beverage containing hundreds of biologically active compounds, and the health effects of chronic coffee intake are wide ranging. From a cardiovascular (CV) standpoint, coffee consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as other conditions associated with CV risk such as obesity and depression; but it may"
