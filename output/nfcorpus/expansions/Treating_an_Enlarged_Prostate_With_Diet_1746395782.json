    "Treating an enlarged prostate with diet can be beneficial in managing the condition and alleviating symptoms. There are several dietary changes that can support prostate health and potentially reduce the size of the prostate gland. Incorporating foods rich in nutrients such as lycopene, a powerful antioxidant found in tomatoes, watermelon, and pink grapefruit, may help decrease prostate inflammation. Additionally, consuming foods high in zinc, such as nuts, seeds, and legumes, can support prostate function and reduce the risk of enlargement.\n\nA diet that is low in saturated fats and processed sugars can also be beneficial for prostate health. Foods like fatty red meats, fried foods, and sugary snacks should be limited as they can contribute to inflammation and overall poor prostate health. Instead, focusing on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients and support overall prostate health.\n\nIncorporating lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy weight can further complement dietary efforts in managing an enlarged prostate. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian can help create a personalized diet plan tailored to individual needs and optimize prostate health. By making mindful dietary choices and adopting a healthy lifestyle, individuals can potentially improve symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate and support overall well-being.",
    "Treating an enlarged prostate with diet can be a beneficial approach to managing symptoms and promoting prostate health. Incorporating whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your diet can help support overall prostate function. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as berries, tomatoes, and nuts, may also be helpful in reducing inflammation and supporting prostate health.\n\nAdditionally, certain dietary modifications can help alleviate symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate. Limiting the consumption of caffeine and alcohol, as these substances can irritate the bladder and worsen urinary symptoms, may be beneficial. Maintaining a healthy weight through proper nutrition and regular exercise is also important, as excess weight can put added pressure on the prostate gland and worsen symptoms.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes to ensure that your diet is balanced and meeting your nutritional needs. Overall, a healthy and balanced diet, combined with regular physical activity, can play a significant role in managing an enlarged prostate and promoting overall prostate health."

    "Treating an Enlarged Prostate With Diet Pilot study of dietary fat restriction and flaxseed supplementation in men with prostate cancer before surgery: exploring the effects on hormonal levels.... Dietary fat and fiber affect hormonal levels and may influence cancer progression. We undertook a pilot study to explore whether a flaxseed-supplemented, fat-restricted diet could affect the biomarkers of prostatic neoplasia. Bitter melon extract impairs prostate cancer cell cycle progression and delays prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in TRAMP model. One of the approaches to control prostate cancer is prevention through diet. For centuries, Ayurveda has recommended the use of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) as a functional food to prevent and treat human health-related.

    "Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: what you need to know.\tPURPOSE: We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of BPO related to BPH; and management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published literature and current treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO. RESULTS: BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is considerable risk of progression, and/or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve",
    "Clinical events in prostate cancer lifestyle trial: results from two years of follow-up.\tOBJECTIVES: Previous research has demonstrated that patients with prostate cancer participating in the Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial had a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, inhibition of LNCaP cell growth, and fewer prostate cancer-related clinical events at the end of 1 year compared with controls. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical events in this trial during a 2-year period. METHODS: The Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial was a 1-year randomized controlled clinical trial of 93 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (Gleason score <7, PSA 4-",

    "Bitter melon extract impairs prostate cancer cell cycle progression and delays prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in TRAMP model\tProstate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Earlier diagnosis increases survival rate in patients. However, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment and prevention are necessary for inhibiting disease progression to a hormone refractory state. One of the approaches to control prostate cancer is prevention through diet, which inhibits one or more neoplastic events and reduces the cancer risk. For centuries, Ayurveda has recommended the use of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) as a functional food to prevent and treat human health related",
    "Dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of renal cell, bladder, and prostate cancer.\tBACKGROUND: Acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen, was recently detected in various heat-treated carbohydrate-rich foods. Epidemiologic studies on the relation with cancer have been few and largely negative. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively examine the association between dietary acrylamide intake and renal cell, bladder, and prostate cancers. DESIGN: The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer includes 120,852 men and women aged 55-69 y. At baseline (1986), a random subcohort of 5000 participants was selected for a case-cohort analysis approach using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Acrylamide intake was assessed with",
