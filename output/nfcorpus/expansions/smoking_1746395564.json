    "Smoking is a harmful habit that can have serious health consequences. It is well known that smoking tobacco can increase the risk of various diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disorders. Additionally, exposure to secondhand smoke can also have detrimental effects on non-smokers. Quitting smoking is one of the best things a person can do for their health and well-being. There are various resources and support systems available to help individuals kick the habit and live a healthier, smoke-free life.",
    "Smoking is a well-known habit that involves the inhalation of smoke produced by burning tobacco or other substances. It is a common practice that can have serious health consequences. Smoking has been linked to various health issues, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Additionally, secondhand smoke from cigarettes can also be harmful to those who are exposed to it. Many countries have implemented smoking bans in public areas to protect people from the dangers of smoking. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your health and reduce the risk of developing smoking-related illnesses. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with smoking and make informed decisions about your health."

    "Physician smoking status, attitudes toward smoking, and cessation advice to patients: an international survey.\tOBJECTIVE: The smoking status of physicians can impact interactions with patients about smoking. The 'Smoking: The Opinions of Physicians' (STOP) survey examined whether an association existed between physician smoking status and beliefs about smoking and cessation and a physician's clinical interactions with patients relevant to smoking cessation, and perceptions of barriers to assisting with quitting. METHODS: General and family practitioners across 16 countries were surveyed via telephone or face-to-face interviews using a convenience-sample methodology. Physician smoking status was self-reported. RESULTS: Of 4473 physicians invited, 2836 (",
    "Cigarette Smoking and Pancreatic Cancer: A Pooled Analysis From the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium\tSmoking is an established risk factor for pancreatic cancer; however, detailed examination of the association of smoking intensity, smoking duration, and cumulative smoking dose with pancreatic cancer is limited. The authors analyzed pooled data from the international Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium nested case-control study (1,481 cases, 1,539 controls). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using unconditional logistic regression. Smoking intensity effects were examined with an excess odds ratio model that was linear in pack-years and exponential in cigarettes smoked per day and its square. When compared with never smokers, current smokers had",
    "Tobacco smoking and chewing, alcohol drinking and lung cancer risk among men in southern India.\tIn India, lung cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers, and tobacco smoking remains its most important etiologic factors. The objective of our study is to examine the effects of different tobacco consumption forms, including smoking and chewing, on lung cancer risk of men in southern India, especially to compare the effects of bidi smoking to cigarette smoking on lung carcinogenesis. We also evaluated the possible role of Indian alcohol beverages and non-Indian alcohol beverages on lung carcinogenesis. We conducted a case-control study in Chennai and Trivandrum. In total, 778 lung cancer cases",
    "Smoking and lung cancer risk in American and Japanese men: an international case-control study.\tRates of lung cancer in American men have greatly exceeded those in Japanese men for several decades despite the higher smoking prevalence in Japanese men. It is not known whether the relative risk of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking is lower in Japanese men than American men and whether these risks vary by the amount and duration of smoking. To estimate smoking-specific relative risks for lung cancer in men, a multicentric case-control study was carried out in New York City, Washington, DC, and Nagoya, Japan from 1992 to 1998. A total of 371 cases and 373",
    "Thirdhand cigarette smoke in an experimental chamber: evidence of surface deposition of nicotine, nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons...\tBACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence shows that secondhand cigarette smoke undergoes numerous chemical changes after it is released into the air: it can adsorb to indoor surfaces, desorb back into the air and undergo chemical changes as it ages. OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of aging on the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nicotine and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cigarette smoke. METHODS: We generated sidestream and mainstream cigarette smoke with a smoking machine, diluted it with conditioned filtered air, and passed it through a 6 m(3) flow reactor with air",
    "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in smoked food products and commercial liquid smoke flavourings.\tSmoked foods including turkey, pork, chicken, beef and fish products were screened for the presence of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Eighteen commercial liquid smoke flavourings and seasonings were also analysed. Total PAH concentrations in smoked meat products ranged from 2.6 micrograms/kg in a cooked ham sample to 29.8 micrograms/kg in grilled pork chops, while those in fish products ranged from 9.3 micrograms/kg in smoked shrimp to 86.6 micrograms/kg in smoked salmon. Total concentrations of the carcinogenic PAHs (benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, and indeno[1,2,3-c",
    "Comparison of the cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of liquid smoke food flavourings, cigarette smoke condensate and wood smoke condensate.\tAlthough products of pyrolysis are often cytotoxic and mutagenic, the relationship between the type of material pyrolysed and the toxicity of the resulting pyrolysis products is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of several types of common pyrolysis products. The cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of these products were assessed by using neutral red uptake and Ames mutagenicity assays, respectively. The biological activities of four liquid smoke food flavourings (LSF) were compared with two other pyrolysis-derived materials; cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and a wood smoke condensate",
    "CANNABIS USE AND RISK OF LUNG CANCER: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY\tAim: To determine the risk of lung cancer associated with cannabis smoking. Methods: A case-control study of lung cancer in adults \u226455 years of age was conducted in eight district health boards in New Zealand. Cases were identified from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and hospital databases. Controls were randomly selected from the electoral roll, with frequency matching to cases in 5-year age groups and district health boards. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to assess possible risk factors including cannabis use. The relative risk of lung cancer associated with cannabis smoking was estimated by logistic regression. Results: There were 79",
    "Associations of dietary dark-green and deep-yellow vegetables and fruits with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: modification by smoking.\tSmoking has been positively and fruit and vegetable intake has been negatively associated with cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women worldwide. However, a lower consumption of fruits and reduced serum carotenoids have been observed among smokers. It is not known whether the smoking effect on the risk of cervical neoplasia is modified by a low intake of fruits and vegetables. The present study examined the combined effects of tobacco smoking and diet using a validated FFQ and serum carotenoid and tocopherol levels on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) risk in a hospital-based",
    "Mutagenicity testing in the Salmonella typhimurium assay of phenolic compounds and phenolic fractions obtained from smokehouse smoke condensates.\tSmokehouse smoke, which is used for flavouring meat products, was investigated for its mutagenic activity in the Salmonella typhimurium assay. We were chiefly concerned with the fractions free of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but containing phenol compounds, which are responsible for the preservative and aromatizing properties of the smoke. The most abundantly occurring phenol compounds (phenol, cresols, 2,4-dimethylphenol, brenzcatechine, syringol, eugenol, vanilline and guaiacol) gave negative results when they were tested for mutagenicity at five concentrations up to 5000 micrograms/plate, with and without S-9 mix, using five strains of S."
