    "Alternative medicine refers to practices and treatments that are used in place of conventional medical therapies. These alternative approaches encompass a wide range of disciplines, including herbal remedies, acupuncture, chiropractic care, meditation, and energy healing. Advocates of alternative medicine often cite its more holistic approach to health, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit.\n\nWhile alternative medicine can provide relief for certain individuals and conditions, it is important to approach these treatments with caution and skepticism. Some alternative therapies lack scientific evidence to support their effectiveness, and others may even be harmful if used improperly. It is always advisable to consult with a qualified healthcare provider before pursuing alternative medicine options, to ensure that you are making informed choices about your health and well-being.",
    "Alternative medicine refers to healthcare practices and treatments that fall outside of the mainstream medical system. These techniques and therapies often focus on holistic approaches to healing, emphasizing the connection between mind, body, and spirit. Alternative medicine encompasses a wide range of practices, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, chiropractic care, homeopathy, and naturopathy. Many people turn to alternative medicine either as a complement to conventional medical treatment or as an alternative when they are dissatisfied with traditional methods. While some alternative practices have scientific evidence to support their effectiveness, others may lack rigorous research to validate their claims. It is important for individuals considering alternative medicine to consult with licensed healthcare professionals and do thorough research to make informed decisions about their health and well-being."

    "Complementary and alternative medicines in irritable bowel syndrome: An integrative view\tIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with a high incidence in the general population. The diagnosis of IBS is mainly based on exclusion of other intestinal conditions through the absence of inflammatory markers and specific antigens. The current pharmacological treatment approaches available focus on reducing symptom severity while often limiting quality of life because of significant side effects. This has led to an effectiveness gap for IBS patients that seek further relief to increase their quality of life. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) have been associated with a higher degree of symptom management and quality of life in IBS patients. Over the past",
    "Antimicrobial properties of Allium sativum (garlic).\tAlthough garlic has been used for its medicinal properties for thousands of years, investigations into its mode of action are relatively recent. Garlic has a wide spectrum of actions; not only is it antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal, but it also has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and immune systems. Resurgence in the use of natural herbal alternatives has brought the use of medicinal plants to the forefront of pharmacological investigations, and many new drugs are being discovered. This review aims to address the historical use of garlic and its sulfur chemistry, and to provide a basis for further research into its antimicrobial properties.",
    "Radioprotection by plant products: present status and future prospects.\tThe development of radioprotective agents has been the subject of intense research in view of their potential for use within a radiation environment, such as space exploration, radiotherapy and even nuclear war. However, no ideal, safe synthetic radioprotectors are available to date, so the search for alternative sources, including plants, has been on going for several decades. In Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, several plants have been used to treat free radical-mediated ailments and, therefore, it is logical to expect that such plants may also render some protection against radiation damage. A systematic screening approach can provide leads",
    "Therapeutic potential of turmeric in Alzheimer's disease: curcumin or curcuminoids?\tAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is limited choice in modern therapeutics, and drugs available have limited success with multiple side effects in addition to high cost. Hence, newer and alternate treatment options are being explored for effective and safer therapeutic targets to address AD. Turmeric possesses multiple medicinal uses including treatment for AD. Curcuminoids, a mixture of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, are vital constituents of turmeric. It is generally believed that curcumin is the most important constituent of the curcuminoid mixture that contributes to the pharmacological profile of parent curcuminoid mixture or turmeric.",
    "Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy.\tAlthough improvement in long-term health is no longer an indication for menopausal hormone therapy, evidence supporting fewer adverse events in younger women, combined with its high overall effectiveness, has reinforced its usefulness for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal therapy has been provided not only by commercially available products but also by compounding, or creation of an individualized preparation in response to a health care provider's prescription to create a medication tailored to the specialized needs of an individual patient.

    "Combinatorial strategies employing nutraceuticals for cancer development.\tCancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the fight against cancer is one of the most important areas of research in medicine, and one that possibly contributes to the increased interest in chemoprevention as an alternative approach to the control of cancer. Cancer prevention by nutraceuticals present in fruits and vegetables has received considerable attention because of their low cost and wide safety margin. A substantial amount of evidence from human, animal, and cell culture studies has shown cancer chemopreventive effects from these natural products. However, single-agent intervention has failed to produce the expected outcome in clinical trials; therefore, combinations of nutraceuticals are",
    "Effect of spearmint (Mentha spicata Labiatae) teas on androgen levels in women with hirsutism.\tMentha spicata Labiatae, known as spearmint and Mentha piperita Labiatae, known as peppermint can be used for various kinds of illnesses in herbal medicine and flavoring in industry. M. spicata Labiatae grows on the Anamas plateau of Yenithornarbademli town of Isparta, located in southwest part of Turkey. In this town, clinicians thought that consumption of tea steeped with M. spicata or M. piperita caused a diminished libido. Because antiandrogenic effects of spearmint and peppermint were found previously in rats, it was decided to observe the effect of this herbal tea on the androgen levels in hirsute women.Twenty-one female",
    "Bacteriophage biocontrol in animals and meat products\tSummary Since their discovery almost a century ago, bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or \u2018phages\u2019) have been used to prevent and treat a multitude of bacterial infections (phage therapy: PT). In addition, they have been the basis for many advances in genetics and biochemistry. Phage therapy was performed on human subjects in the United States, Europe and Asia in the few decades following their discovery. However, Western countries largely abandoned PT in favour of antibiotics in the 1940s. The relatively recent renaissance of PT in the West can be attributed partly to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human and animal pathogens. However, the",
