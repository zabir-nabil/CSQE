    "Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that comes from the coca plant. It is commonly used for its euphoric and alertness-inducing effects. However, cocaine is also highly addictive and can have serious negative consequences on a person's health and well-being. Long-term use of cocaine can lead to a variety of physical and mental health issues, including heart problems, respiratory issues, and psychological dependence. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with cocaine use and seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction to this drug.",
    "Cocaine is a powerful stimulant drug that affects the central nervous system. It is derived from the coca plant and is known for its euphoric effects and increased energy levels upon consumption. Cocaine is a highly addictive substance and can have serious negative consequences on both physical and mental health. The use of cocaine can lead to feelings of paranoia, heart problems, and even overdose in severe cases. It is important to be aware of the dangers of cocaine use and seek help if struggling with addiction to this drug."

    "Cue-induced cocaine craving: neuroanatomical specificity for drug users and drug stimuli.\tOBJECTIVE: Cocaine-related cues have been hypothesized to perpetuate drug abuse by inducing a craving response that prompts drug-seeking behavior. However, the mechanisms, underlying neuroanatomy, and specificity of this neuroanatomy are not yet fully understood. METHOD: To address these issues, experienced cocaine users (N=17) and comparison subjects (N=14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing three separate films that portrayed 1 ) individuals smoking crack cocaine, 2) outdoor nature scenes, and 3) explicit sexual content. Candidate craving sites were identified as those that showed significant activation in the cocaine users when viewing"
