    "Chanterelle mushrooms are a type of wild mushroom known for their delicate flavor and unique appearance. These mushrooms are easily recognizable by their funnel-shaped caps, which range in color from golden yellow to orange. Chanterelles can be found in forests and woodlands across North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly during the late summer and fall months. They are prized by chefs and foragers alike for their fruity aroma and peppery taste, making them a popular choice for gourmet dishes. Chanterelle mushrooms can be saut\u00e9ed, added to soups and stews, or even enjoyed raw in salads. With their rich flavor profile and versatility in cooking, chanterelles are a beloved ingredient in many culinary traditions around the world.",
    "Chanterelle mushrooms are a highly sought-after variety known for their delicate texture and unique flavor. These mushrooms are typically golden or yellow in color and have a funnel-like shape with ridges on the underside instead of gills. They can be found in forests worldwide, often growing near trees such as oaks, beeches, and pines. Chanterelles are prized by chefs for their fruity and peppery taste, which pairs well with a variety of dishes. They can be saut\u00e9ed, grilled, or used in soups and sauces to add a gourmet touch to any meal. Harvesting chanterelles should be done carefully, as they are often foraged in the wild and can be confused with poisonous mushrooms. It's always best to consult with an expert or experienced forager before consuming any wild mushrooms."

    "Vitamin D and sterol composition of 10 types of mushrooms from retail suppliers in the United States.\tVitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol) and sterols were analyzed in mushrooms sampled nationwide in the United States to update the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Vitamin D(2) was assayed using HPLC with [(3)H]-vitamin D(3) internal standard and sterols by GC-FID mass spectrometric (MS) confirmation. Vitamin D(2) was low (0.1-0.3 \u03bcg/100 g) in Agaricus bisporus (white button, crimini, portabella) and enoki, moderate in shiitake and oyster (0.4-0.7 \u03bcg/100 g), and high in morel, chanterelle, maitake (5.2-28.1 \u03bcg/100 g",
    "Influence of storage and household processing on the agaritine content of the cultivated Agaricus mushroom.\tAgaritine (N-(gamma-L(+)-glutamyl)-4-hydroxymethyl-phenylhydrazine) was identified and quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography and used as a marker for the occurrence of phenylhydrazine derivatives in the cultivated Agaricus bitorquis and A. garicus hortensis mushrooms. Although relatively high levels of agaritine (around 700 mg kg(-1)) could be found in freshly harvested A. bitorquis from early flushes, samples from supermarkets contained less agaritine. The content of 28 samples varied between 165 and 457 mg kg(-1), on average being 272 +/- 69 mg kg(-1). The highest amounts of agaritine were found in the skin of the",
    "Dietary intakes of mushrooms and green tea combine to reduce the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women.\tTo investigate effects of dietary mushrooms and joint effects of mushrooms and green tea on breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted in southeast China in 2004-2005. The incident cases were 1,009 female patients aged 20-87 years with histologically confirmed breast cancer. The 1,009 age-matched controls were healthy women randomly recruited from outpatient breast clinics. Information on frequency and quantity of dietary intake of mushrooms and tea consumption, usual diet, and lifestyle were collected by face-to-face interview using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Compared with nonconsumers, the Odds",
    "Mushrooms, tumors, and immunity: an update.\tThere is significant interest in the use of mushrooms and/or mushroom extracts as dietary supplements based on theories that they enhance immune function and promote health. To some extent, select mushrooms have been shown to have stimulatory action on immune responsiveness, particularly when studied in vitro. However, despite their widespread use for potential health benefits, there is a surprising paucity of epidemiologic and experimental studies that address the biologic activities of mushrooms after oral administration to animals or humans. There have been a number of studies that have addressed the ability of mushrooms to modulate mononuclear cell activation and the phenotypic expression of cytokines and their cognate receptors. There",
    "The immunobiology of mushrooms.\tThere has been enormous interest in the biologic activity of mushrooms and innumerable claims have been made that mushrooms have beneficial effects on immune function with subsequent implications for inhibition of tumor growth. The majority of these observations are anecdotal and often lack standardization. However, there remains considerable data on both in vitro and in vivo effects that reflect on the potential of mushroom compounds to influence human immunity. A number of these effects are beneficial but, unfortunately, many responses are still characterized based on phenomenology and there is more speculation than substance. With respect to tumor biology, although many neoplastic lesions are immunogenic, tumor antigens frequently are self antigens and induce tolerance",
    "Chemical composition and nutritional value of the most widely appreciated cultivated mushrooms: an inter-species comparative study.\tHerein, it was reported and compared the chemical composition and nutritional value of the most consumed species as fresh cultivated mushrooms: Agaricus bisporus (white and brown mushrooms), Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom), Pleurotus eryngii (King oyster mushroom), Lentinula edodes (Shiitake) and Flammulina velutipes (Golden needle mushroom).

    "Bioavailability of vitamin D\u2082 from UV-B-irradiated button mushrooms in healthy adults deficient in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D: a randomized controll...\tBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mushrooms contain very little or any vitamin D(2) but are abundant in ergosterol, which can be converted into vitamin D(2) by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Our objective was to investigate the bioavailability of vitamin D(2) from vitamin D(2)-enhanced mushrooms by UV-B in humans, and comparing it with a vitamin D(2) supplement. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fresh mushrooms were irradiated with an UV-B dose of 1.5 J/cm(2), increasing vitamin D(2) content from <1 to 491 \u03bcg/100 g and",
    "Ergocalciferol from mushrooms or supplements consumed with a standard meal increases 25-hydroxyergocalciferol but decreases 25-hydroxycholecalcifer...\tFew foods contain ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. Treatment of mushrooms with UV light increases ergocalciferol content and could provide a dietary source of vitamin D. We evaluated the impact of consuming UV-treated white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) on the vitamin D status of healthy adults. Thirty-eight volunteers were randomized to 4 treatments consumed with a standard meal for 6 wk: the control (C) group received untreated mushrooms providing 0.85 \u03bcg/d ergocalciferol (n = 10); groups M1 and M2 received UV-treated mushrooms providing 8.8 (n = 10) and 17.1",
    "Vitamin D deficiency treated by consuming UVB-irradiated mushrooms\tDeficiency of vitamin D is usually caused by dietary deficiency and/or lack of exposure to sunlight in dark skinned individuals living at northern latitudes. Simple vitamin D deficiency is commonly treated by prescribing a vitamin D containing calcium supplement. This report presents a patient who rejected this approach and instead, after researching alternative treatment options independently, opted to self-treat by consuming UVB-irradiated mushrooms. The beneficial effect of this on the patient's plasma biochemical markers is shown. Further research into the beneficial effect of consuming UVB-irradiated mushrooms is required.",
