    "Pesticides are chemical substances used to control and eliminate pests such as insects, weeds, and diseases that can harm crops and create economic losses for farmers. These chemicals are designed to target specific pests and protect plants from damage, thus ensuring higher yields and better quality produce. However, the use of pesticides has raised concerns about their potential negative impact on human health and the environment. Excessive use of pesticides can contaminate soil and water, harm beneficial insects like bees, and pose health risks to farmworkers and consumers. Therefore, it is essential for farmers to follow proper application methods and safety precautions when using pesticides to minimize these risks and protect both the environment and public health.",
    "Pesticides are substances used to kill or control pests like insects, weeds, fungi, and rodents that can damage crops, livestock, and property. These chemicals are applied in agriculture, forestry, and public health to protect plants and prevent the spread of diseases. While pesticides can be effective in managing pest populations, it is essential to use them responsibly to minimize the impact on the environment, human health, and non-target species. Regulatory agencies establish guidelines for the proper use of pesticides to ensure their safe and effective application. Farmers, pest control operators, and consumers are encouraged to follow best practices, such as using alternative pest management strategies and selecting least-toxic pesticides, to mitigate the potential risks associated with pesticide use. By balancing the benefits and potential hazards of pesticides, we can support sustainable agriculture and protect the health of ecosystems and communities."

    "pesticides, Pesticides are one of the major inputs used for increasing agricultural productivity of crops. The pesticide residues, left to variable extent in the food materials after harvesting, are beyond the control of the consumer and have deleterious effects on human health. There is growing evidence on the association between long-term exposure to pesticides in occupational settings and an elevated rate of chronic diseases, including different types of cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the putative associations of environmental pesticide exposures in the general population with several cancer sites and to discuss potential carcinogenic mechanisms by which pesticides develop cancer. Consumers are frequently urged to avoid imported foods as well as specific fruits and vegetables due to health concerns from pesticide residues and are often encouraged to choose organic fruits and vegetables rather than conventional forms. While organic fruits and vegetables have lower levels of pesticide residues than do conventional fruits and vegetables, pesticide residues are still frequently detected on organic fruits and vegetables.

    "Effect of handling and processing on pesticide residues in food- a review\tPesticides are one of the major inputs used for increasing agricultural productivity of crops. The pesticide residues, left to variable extent in the food materials after harvesting, are beyond the control of consumer and have deleterious effect on human health. The presence of pesticide residues is a major bottleneck in the international trade of food commodities. The localization of pesticides in foods varies with the nature of pesticide molecule, type and portion of food material and environmental factors. The food crops treated with pesticides invariably contain unpredictable amount of these chemicals, therefore, it becomes imperative to find out some alternatives for decontamination of foods. The",
    "Variability in Pesticide Deposition and Source Contributions to Snowpack in Western US National Parks\tFifty-six seasonal snowpack samples were collected at remote alpine, sub-arctic, and arctic sites in eight Western US national parks during three consecutive years (2003\u20132005). Four current-use pesticides (CUPs) (dacthal (DCPA), chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)) and four historic-use pesticides (HUPs) (dieldrin, \u03b1-HCH, chlordane, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) were commonly measured at all sites, during all years. The mean coefficient of variation for pesticide concentrations was 15% for site replicate samples, 41% for",
    "Environmental exposure to pesticides and cancer risk in multiple human organ systems.\tThere is growing evidence on the association between long-term exposure to pesticides in occupational settings and an elevated rate of chronic diseases, including different types of cancer. However, data on non-occupational exposures are scarce to draw any conclusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the putative associations of environmental pesticide exposures in the general population with several cancer sites and to discuss potential carcinogenic mechanisms by which pesticides develop cancer. A population-based case-control study was conducted among people residing in 10 Health districts from Andalusia (South Spain) to estimate the risk of cancer at different sites.",
    "Persistence of human norovirus in reconstituted pesticides--pesticide application as a possible source of viruses in fresh produce chains.\tThe consumption of fresh produce is frequently associated with outbreaks of human norovirus (hNoV) disease. To prevent the contamination of fresh produce with hNoV, knowledge of the possible introduction sources of the viruses, such as water, is needed to be able to implement appropriate and efficient preventive measures. Contaminated water used to reconstitute pesticides could be a relevant source of infectious hNoV, determined by the initial level of virus contamination and the persistence of these viruses in reconstituted pesticides. We studied the persistence of hNoV GI.4, hNoV GII.4 and murine norovirus (MNV-1), the",
    "Reduction of pesticide residues on produce by rinsing.\tIn 1997 this laboratory initiated a research program with the objective of examining the effect that rinsing of produce with tap water would have on pesticide residues. Samples were obtained from local markets and/or grown at our experimental farm. Because approximately 35% of produce from retail sources contains pesticide residues, growing and treating produce at an experimental farm had the advantage that all such samples contain pesticide residues. Pesticides were applied under normal field conditions to a variety of food crops and the vegetation was allowed to undergo natural weathering prior to harvest. The resulting samples contained field-incurred or \"field-fortified\" residues. This experimental design was",
    "Chronic dietary risk characterization for pesticide residues: a ranking and scoring method integrating agricultural uses and food contamination data.\tA method has been developed to identify pesticide residues and foodstuffs for inclusion in national monitoring programs with different priority levels. It combines two chronic dietary intake indicators: ATMDI based on maximum residue levels and agricultural uses, and EDI on food contamination data. The mean and 95th percentile of exposure were calculated for 490 substances using individual and national consumption data. The results show that mean ATMDI exceeds the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for 10% of the pesticides, and the mean upper-bound EDI is above the ADI for 1.8% of substances. A seven",
    "Pesticide residues in imported, organic, and \"suspect\" fruits and vegetables.\tConsumers are frequently urged to avoid imported foods as well as specific fruits and vegetables due to health concerns from pesticide residues and are often encouraged to choose organic fruits and vegetables rather than conventional forms. Studies have demonstrated that while organic fruits and vegetables have lower levels of pesticide residues than do conventional fruits and vegetables, pesticide residues are still frequently detected on organic fruits and vegetables; typical dietary consumer exposure to pesticide residues from conventional fruits and vegetables does not appear to be of health significance. Similarly, research does not demonstrate that imported fruits and vegetables pose greater risks from pesticide residues than do domestic",
    "Detection of toxic heavy metals and pesticide residue in herbal plants which are commonly used in the herbal formulations.\tHerbal formulations are getting popular throughout the world and commercialized extensively for various medicinal properties. WHO has emphasized the need for quality assurance of herbal products, including testing of heavy metals and pesticides residues. In view of WHO guidelines, single herbal drugs used in herbal formulations were collected from local market, for testing heavy metals and persistent pesticides residue. Therefore, in the present case, we have examined few local samples of certain herbs viz. Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica, and Withania somnifera. The present studies were selected for estimation of four heavy metals",

    "Integrative assessment of multiple pesticides as risk factors for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among men\tMethods: During the 1980s, the National Cancer Institute conducted three case-control studies of NHL in the midwestern United States. These pooled data were used to examine pesticide exposures in farming as risk factors for NHL in men. The large sample size (n = 3417) allowed analysis of 47 pesticides simultaneously, controlling for potential confounding by other pesticides in the model, and adjusting the estimates based on a prespecified variance to make them more stable. Results: Reported use of several individual pesticides was associated with increased NHL incidence, including organophosphate insecticides coumaphos, diazinon, and fonofos, insecticides"
