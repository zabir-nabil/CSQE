    "Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant, native to South America. It is known for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in the leaves. Stevia is a popular alternative to sugar due to its zero-calorie content and low impact on blood sugar levels, making it a suitable option for people with diabetes or those looking to reduce their sugar intake. Additionally, stevia is considered safe for consumption and has been approved as a food additive by various regulatory agencies around the world. Overall, stevia provides a natural and healthier way to satisfy a sweet tooth without the drawbacks associated with consuming traditional sugar.",
    "Stevia is a natural sweetener that comes from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant. It is often used as a healthier alternative to sugar due to its zero-calorie content and low glycemic index. Stevia is significantly sweeter than sugar, so only a small amount is needed to sweeten beverages or food. Many people choose stevia for its ability to add sweetness without the negative effects associated with consuming too much sugar. Additionally, stevia is considered safe for most people, including those with diabetes, as it does not affect blood sugar levels. Overall, stevia is a popular choice for individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake and make healthier choices in their diet."

    "stevia, Stevia has been used throughout the world since ancient times for various purposes; for example, as a sweetener and a medicine. Stevia is likely to become a major source of high-potency sweetener for the growing natural food market in the future. Extracts of the leaves of the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) are used to sweeten food and beverages in South America, Japan, and China. The components responsible for the sweet properties of the plant are glycosides of steviol, primary stevioside, which is 250-300 times sweeter than sucrose. Stevioside, a constituent of Stevia rebaudiana, is commonly used as a non-caloric sugar substitute in Japan. Stevioside was not mutagenic in any of the assays examined. The aglycone, steviol, however, produced dose-related positive responses in some mutagenicity tests.",

    "Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) a bio-sweetener: a review.\tStudies revealed that Stevia has been used throughout the world since ancient times for various purposes; for example, as a sweetener and a medicine. We conducted a systematic literature review to summarize and quantify the past and current evidence for Stevia. We searched relevant papers up to 2007 in various databases. As we know that the leaves of Stevia plants have functional and sensory properties superior to those of many other high-potency sweeteners, Stevia is likely to become a major source of high-potency sweetener for the growing natural food market in the future. Although Stevia can be helpful to anyone, there are",
    "A critical review of the genetic toxicity of steviol and steviol glycosides.\tExtracts of the leaves of the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) are used to sweeten food and beverages in South America, Japan and China. The components responsible for the sweet properties of the plant are glycosides of steviol, primary stevioside (ent-13-hydroxykaur-16-en-18-oic acid), which is 250-300 times sweeter than sucrose and rebaudiosides A and C. Stevioside and steviol have been subjected to extensive genetic testing. The majority of the findings show no evidence of genotoxic activity. Neither stevioside nor its aglycone steviol have been shown to react directly with DNA or demonstrate genotoxic damage in assays relevant",
    "Evaluation of the genotoxicity of stevioside and steviol using six in vitro and one in vivo mutagenicity assays.\tStevioside, a constituent of Stevia rebaudiana, is commonly used as a non-caloric sugar substitute in Japan. The genetic toxicities of stevioside and its aglycone, steviol, were examined with seven mutagenicity tests using bacteria (reverse mutation assay, forward mutation assay, umu test and rec assay), cultured mammalian cells (chromosomal aberration test and gene mutation assay) and mice (micronucleus test). Stevioside was not mutagenic in any of the assays examined. The aglycone, steviol, however, produced dose-related positive responses in some mutagenicity tests, i.e. the forward mutation"
