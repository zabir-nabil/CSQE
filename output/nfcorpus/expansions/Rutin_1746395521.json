    "Rutin is a bioflavonoid compound that is commonly found in certain fruits and vegetables. It is known for its antioxidant properties and potential health benefits. Rutin is believed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, as well as the ability to strengthen blood vessels and reduce the risk of blood clots. This compound is often used in traditional medicine for its potential to support cardiovascular health and improve circulation. Rutin can also be taken as a dietary supplement to help boost overall health and well-being.",
    "Rutin is a bioflavonoid that belongs to the flavonoid group of polyphenols. It is commonly found in various plants, such as buckwheat, citrus fruits, and berries. Rutin is known for its antioxidant properties and its ability to help strengthen blood vessels and reduce inflammation. This compound has been studied for its potential health benefits, including improving blood circulation, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and supporting overall heart health. Rutin is often used as a dietary supplement and is also found in some skincare products for its anti-inflammatory and protective effects on the skin."

Examples of such polyphenols are isothiocyanates in cabbage and broccoli, epigallocatechin in green tea, capsaicin in chili peppers, chalones, rutin, and naringenin in apples. Many studies suggest that the effect of treatment can be improved by a combination of restriction in intake of proinflammatory molecules such as advanced glycation end products (AGE) and advanced lipoperoxidation end products (ALE). The protective effect of the flavonoids on food-mutagen-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes from colon cancer patients. This study investigates the protective potential of the flavonoids quercetin (Q) and rutin (R) against oxidative stress induced in vitro by IQ and PhIP in lymphocytes from healthy individuals and untreated, newly diagnosed colon cancer patients using the Comet assay.

    "Plant-derived health: the effects of turmeric and curcuminoids.\tPlants contain numerous polyphenols, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and hereby to increase resistance to disease. Examples of such polyphenols are isothiocyanates in cabbage and broccoli, epigallocatechin in green tee, capsaicin in chili peppers, chalones, rutin and naringenin in apples, resveratrol in red wine and fresh peanuts and curcumin/curcuminoids in turmeric. Most diseases are maintained by a sustained discreet but obvious increased systemic inflammation. Many studies suggest that the effect of treatment can be improved by a combination of restriction in intake of proinflammatory molecules such as advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced lipoperoxidation end products (ALE)",
