    "Mastitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the breast tissue, usually caused by an infection. It commonly affects breastfeeding mothers but can also occur in non-lactating individuals. Symptoms of mastitis may include breast pain, redness, swelling, warmth to the touch, and fever. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to clear the infection, along with measures to relieve symptoms such as pain and swelling. It is important to continue breastfeeding or express milk to help clear the infection and prevent complications. In some cases, mastitis can develop into a more serious condition, so it is advisable to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.",
    "Mastitis is a common condition that involves the inflammation of breast tissue, often caused by bacterial infection. This condition mostly affects breastfeeding women, as bacteria can enter the breast through a cracked or sore nipple during nursing. Symptoms of mastitis include breast tenderness, redness, swelling, and warmth, accompanied by fever and flu-like symptoms. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to combat the infection, along with rest, frequent nursing or pumping, and applying warm compresses to the affected breast. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you suspect you have mastitis, as untreated cases can lead to complications such as abscess formation."

Mixed models with repeated measures were used to compare milk yield and SCC, and survival analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio for CM and culling.

    "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in food production animals.\tUntil recently, reports on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in food production animals were mainly limited to occasional detections in dairy cattle mastitis. However, since 2005 a MRSA clone, CC398, has been reported colonizing pigs, veal calves and broiler chickens and infecting dairy cows. Many aspects of its prevalence in pigs remain unclear. In other livestock, colonizing capacity and reservoir status still require elucidation. MRSA CC398 has also been detected in meat, but, as for other MRSA, the risk this poses is somewhat unclear. Currently, the most worrying aspect of MRSA CC398 appears to be its"
