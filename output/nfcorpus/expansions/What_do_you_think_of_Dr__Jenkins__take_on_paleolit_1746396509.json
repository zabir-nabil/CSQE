    "Dr. Jenkins' perspective on paleolithic diets is both informative and thought-provoking. His research and analysis shed light on the potential benefits and drawbacks of following a diet that mirrors the eating habits of our ancestors from the Paleolithic era. By examining the nutritional composition of foods consumed during that time, Dr. Jenkins offers valuable insights into the potential health implications of adopting a paleolithic diet in the modern context. While some may find his views convincing and may choose to embrace this dietary approach, others may have reservations based on scientific evidence or personal preferences. Overall, Dr. Jenkins' take on paleolithic diets is a valuable contribution to the ongoing conversation about the optimal dietary choices for promoting health and wellness.",
    "Dr. Jenkins' take on paleolithic diets presents an interesting perspective on the benefits of adopting a dietary approach that mimics our ancestors' eating habits. By emphasizing whole, unprocessed foods such as lean meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, Dr. Jenkins highlights the potential health advantages of consuming more natural, nutrient-dense foods. He argues that by avoiding processed foods, added sugars, and refined grains, individuals can experience improved energy levels, better weight management, enhanced digestion, and reduced inflammation. While some may question the strict adherence to a paleolithic diet based on the limited availability of certain foods in modern times, Dr. Jenkins' advocacy for a more whole-food focused approach is certainly worth considering for those seeking to optimize their health through dietary choices."

    "You AhR what you eat: linking diet and immunity.\tThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is responsible for the toxic effects of environmental pollutants such as dioxin, but little is known about its normal physiological functions. Li et al. (2011) now show that specific dietary compounds present in cruciferous vegetables act through the AhR to promote intestinal immune function, revealing AhR as a critical link between diet and immunity.

    "You Are What You Eat: Within-Subject Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Confer Beneficial Skin-Color Changes\tBackground Fruit and vegetable consumption and ingestion of carotenoids have been found to be associated with human skin-color (yellowness) in a recent cross-sectional study. This carotenoid-based coloration contributes beneficially to the appearance of health in humans and is held to be a sexually selected cue of condition in other species. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we investigate the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on skin-color longitudinally to determine the magnitude and duration of diet change required to change skin-color perceptibly. Diet and skin-color were recorded at baseline and",
    "Facing the facelessness of public health: what's the public got to do with it?\tDespite compelling statistics that show we could eliminate 80%of all heart disease and strokes, 90% of all diabetes, and 60% of all cancers with basic lifestyle changes, we have failed to motivate the public to make these changes and failed to motivate policy makers to make healthy choices the easiest choice. Dr. Katz suggests we have failed because we have focused too much on statistics and too little on passion. He implores all of us to tap into people's passion by connecting each of these statistics with a human story.",
    "Does having a drink help you think? 6-7-Year-old children show improvements in cognitive performance from baseline to test after having a drink of ...\tLittle research has examined the effect of water consumption on cognition in children. We examined whether drinking water improves performance from baseline to test in twenty-three 6-7-year-old children. There were significant interactions between time of test and water group (water/no water), with improvements in the water group on thirst and happiness ratings, visual attention and visual search, but not visual memory or visuomotor performance. These results indicate that even under conditions of mild dehydration, not as a",
    "An open label, randomized, fixed-dose, crossover study comparing efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate and saffron (Crocus sativus Linn.) for t...\tSaffron (Crocus sativus Linn.) have been perceived by the public as a strong aphrodisiac herbal product. However, studies addressing the potential beneficial effects of saffron on erectile function (EF) in men with ED are lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saffron administration on EF in men with ED. After a 4-week baseline assessment, 346 men with ED (mean age 46.6+/-8.4 years) were randomized to receive on-demand sildenafil for 12 weeks followed by 30 mg saffron twice",

Methods This was an anonymous questionnaire survey carried out in a single primary care group. A random sample of patients from the practice list stratified by age and gender were surveyed to determine what benefit they required before deciding to receive first and subsequent drugs to treat hypertension. They were asked to indicate the largest number needing treatment for 5 years (NNT5) to prevent myocardial infarction in 1 (smallest benefit) that",

Whereas this model remains useful, we argue that its utility in explaining the evolution of human dietary tendencies is limited.

    "Do phytoestrogens reduce the risk of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence? What clinicians need to know.\tOestrogen is an important determinant of breast cancer risk. Oestrogen-mimicking plant compounds called phytoestrogens can bind to oestrogen receptors and exert weak oestrogenic effects. Despite this activity, epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of breast cancer is lower in countries where the intake of phytoestrogens is high, implying that these compounds may reduce breast cancer risk, and possibly have an impact on survival. Isoflavones and lignans are the most common phytoestrogens in the diet. In this article, we present findings from human observational and intervention studies related to both isoflavone and lignan exposure and breast cancer risk and"
