    "Preventing abdominal aortic aneurysms involves adopting a healthy lifestyle and managing any risk factors that could contribute to the development of this condition. To help prevent abdominal aortic aneurysms, individuals should focus on maintaining a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while minimizing the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and processed foods. Regular physical activity can also play a key role in promoting overall cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of aneurysm formation.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption, as these habits can significantly increase the risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. Being proactive about managing conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes can also help in preventing the development or progression of aneurysms. Regular visits to a healthcare provider for check-ups and screenings can be beneficial in monitoring and addressing any potential risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Ultimately, by making healthy lifestyle choices and actively managing associated risk factors, individuals can take important steps towards preventing abdominal aortic aneurysms.",
    "Abdominal aortic aneurysms can be a serious health concern, but there are several steps individuals can take to help prevent them. One of the most important ways to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysms is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This includes eating a balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and cholesterol, quitting smoking, and engaging in regular physical activity. High blood pressure and cholesterol levels are risk factors for developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, so it is essential to manage these conditions through lifestyle changes and medication if necessary.\n\nRegular health check-ups are also crucial in preventing abdominal aortic aneurysms. Screening tests, such as ultrasound exams, can help detect an aneurysm before it becomes a serious problem. Individuals who are at higher risk, such as older adults and individuals with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms, should especially prioritize these screenings.\n\nIn addition to lifestyle changes and regular screenings, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, such as sudden severe pain in the abdomen or back, and seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms arise. By taking proactive steps to maintain a healthy lifestyle, undergo regular screenings, and stay informed about the signs and symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysms, individuals can help reduce their risk of developing this potentially life-threatening condition."

    "How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted.",
    "How to Help Prevent Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. A robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. Obesity is associated with a great diversity of diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Oat, rich in beta-glucan, had a metabolic-regulating and liver-protecting effect in an animal model. In this study, we performed a clinical trial to further confirm the effect of oat. Atherosclerosis can obstruct branching arteries of the abdominal aorta, including four paired lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery that feed the lumbar spine. The diminished blood flow could result in various back problems. This review spotlights strategic steps that could be a turning point in the dramatic lowering of Alzheimer prevalence. The main strategy includes application of four pillars of prevention: 1) early identification of AD vascular risk factors; 2) early detection of AD vascular risk factors; 3) early intervention of AD vascular risk factors based on evidence-based medical decisions. The regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion lowers the age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone."

    "Analysis of risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm in a cohort of more than 3 million individuals.\tBACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk. METHODS: We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We observed a positive association with increasing years of",
    "The Collateral Network Concept: A Reassessment of the Anatomy of Spinal Cord Perfusion\tOBJECTIVE Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. An anatomical study was undertaken. METHODS Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a low-viscosity acrylic resin at physiological pressures. After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopy",
    "Aneurysm and Neurocysticercosis: Casual or Causal Relationship? Case Report and Review of the Literature\tFour cases of suggestive inflammatory aneurysms in patients with neurocysticercosis have been described. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm and had a casual relationship with neurocysticercosis. At surgery, a viable cysticercus without signs of inflammation or thickened leptomeninges was found in the distal position of the aneurysm. Postoperatively, the patient received albendazole and dextrochlorpheniramine. In the subsequent three years, the patient was asymptomatic and took drugs to prevent convulsion and arterial hypertension. The relationship between NCC and the presence of cerebral aneurysm is discussed",
    "Energy Balance and Obesity\tThis paper describes the interplay among energy intake, energy expenditure and body energy stores and illustrates how an understanding of energy balance can help develop strategies to reduce obesity. First, reducing obesity will require modifying both energy intake and energy expenditure and not simply focusing on either alone. Food restriction alone will not be effective in reducing obesity if human physiology is biased toward achieving energy balance at a high energy flux (i.e. at a high level of energy intake and expenditure). In previous environments a high energy flux was achieved with a high level of physical activity but in today's sedentary environment it is increasingly achieved through weight gain. Matching energy intake to",
    "Oat prevents obesity and abdominal fat distribution, and improves liver function in humans.\tObesity is associated with a great diversity of diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our recent report suggested that oat, rich in beta-glucan, had a metabolic-regulating and liver-protecting effect in an animal model. In this study, we performed a clinical trial to further confirm the effect of oat. Subjects with BMI \u226527 and aged 18-65, were randomly divided into a control (n=18) and an oat-treated (n=16) group, taking a placebo or beta glucan-containing oat cereal, respectively, for 12 weeks. Our data showed that",
    "Atherosclerosis and disc degeneration/low-back pain--a systematic review.\tOBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis can obstruct branching arteries of the abdominal aorta, including four paired lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery that feed the lumbar spine. The diminished blood flow could result in various back problems. The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess associations between atherosclerosis and disc degeneration (DD) or low-back pain (LBP). DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the Medline/PubMed database for all original articles on atherosclerosis and DD/LBP published until October 2008. The search was performed with the medical subject headings atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk factor, or vascular disease and",
    "A turning point for Alzheimer's disease?\tDespite an archive of over 73,000 research papers published in the last two decades on the subject of Alzheimer's disease (AD), little clinical progress has been made relative to how people get sporadic AD and what can be done to help them avoid it. This review spotlights strategic steps that could be a turning point in the dramatic lowering of Alzheimer prevalence. The main strategy includes application of four pillars of prevention: 1) early identification of AD vascular risk factors; 2) early detection of AD vascular risk factors; 3) early intervention of AD vascular risk factors based on evidence-based medical decisions; 4) patient",
    "Addition of milk prevents vascular protective effects of tea.\tAIMS: Experimental and clinical studies indicate that tea exerts protection against cardiovascular diseases. However, a question of much debate is whether addition of milk modifies the biological activities of tea. We studied the vascular effects of tea, with or without milk, in humans and elucidated the impact of individual milk proteins in cell culture experiments, with isolated rat aortic rings and by HPLC analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 16 healthy female volunteers consumed either 500 mL of freshly brewed black tea, black tea with 10% skimmed milk, or boiled water as control. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured by",
    "The effect of enteric-coated, delayed-release peppermint oil on irritable bowel syndrome.\tHerbal remedies, particularly peppermint, have been reported to be helpful in controlling symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study on 90 outpatients with IBS. Subjects took one capsule of enteric-coated, delayed-release peppermint oil (Colpermin) or placebo three times daily for 8 weeks. We visited patients after the first, fourth, and eighth weeks and evaluated their symptoms and quality of life. The number of subjects free from abdominal pain or discomfort changed from 0 at week 0 to 14 at week 8 in the",
    "Effect of endurance exercise training and curcumin intake on central arterial hemodynamics in postmenopausal women: pilot study.\tBACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification (i.e., regular physical activity and diet) is effective in preventing the age-related increase in cardiovascular disease risks. Potential therapeutic effects of curcumin (diferuloylmethane) have been confirmed on various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, but the effects of curcumin have not been tested on central arterial hemodynamics. The aim of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion lowers the age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone in"
