    "Low-carb diets have gained popularity in recent years for their potential benefits in weight loss and improving certain health markers. By reducing the intake of carbohydrates, particularly refined sugars and processed grains, individuals following a low-carb diet may experience more stable blood sugar levels, reduced cravings, and increased satiety. This can lead to decreased overall calorie intake and potentially aid in weight loss. Additionally, some studies suggest that low-carb diets may have favorable effects on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and markers of inflammation. However, it is important to note that individual responses to low-carb diets can vary, and consulting with a healthcare provider or nutritionist before making significant dietary changes is recommended to ensure nutritional adequacy and suitability for individual health goals.",
    "Low-carb diets have gained popularity in recent years due to their potential health benefits. These diets typically limit the intake of carbohydrates, which are found in foods such as bread, pasta, and sugary treats. By reducing carb consumption, the body is forced to burn stored fat for energy instead of relying on carbohydrates. This process, known as ketosis, can lead to weight loss and improved blood sugar levels. However, it's essential to choose nutrient-dense foods and balance macros to ensure you're still getting essential nutrients while following a low-carb diet. Consulting with a healthcare provider or nutritionist can help you tailor a low-carb eating plan that fits your individual needs and goals."

    "low-carb diets Effects of very-low-carbohydrate (horsemeat- or beef-based) diets and restricted feeding on weight gain, feed and energy efficiency... We determined the effect of a low-carb diet and restricted feeding on serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, ketone bodies and insulin in rats. The effect of a plant-based low-carbohydrate ('Eco-Atkins') diet on body weight and blood lipid concentrations in hyperlipidemic subjects. Our objective was to determine the effect on weight loss and LDL-C concentration of a low-carbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins from gluten, soy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and vegetable oils. Effectiveness of a soy-based compared with a traditional low-calorie diet on weight loss and lipid levels in overweight adults. The soy-based low-calorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source, and the traditional low-calorie group consumed two-thirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200 kcal/d diet.",

    "Effects of very-low-carbohydrate (horsemeat- or beef-based) diets and restricted feeding on weight gain, feed and energy efficiency, as well as ser...\tBACKGROUND/AIMS: The beneficial or harmful effect of the low-carbohydrate (low-carb), high-protein, high-fat diet (Atkins diet) has not been clearly demonstrated. We determined the effect of a low-carb diet and restricted feeding (70% ad libitum intake) on serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, ketone bodies and insulin in rats. METHODS: In experiment 1, each of 4 groups with 10 adult rats was assigned to a high-",
    "Long-term low-calorie low-protein vegan diet and endurance exercise are associated with low cardiometabolic risk.\tBACKGROUND: Western diets, which typically contain large amounts of energy-dense processed foods, together with a sedentary lifestyle are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. We evaluated the long-term effects of consuming a low-calorie low-protein vegan diet or performing regular endurance exercise on cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated in 21 sedentary subjects, who had been on a low-calorie low-protein raw vegan diet for 4.4 +/- 2.8 years, (mean age, 53.1 +/- 11 yrs",
    "Long-term low-protein, low-calorie diet and endurance exercise modulate metabolic factors associated with cancer risk.\tBACKGROUND: Western diets, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles are associated with increased cancer risk. The mechanisms responsible for this increased risk, however, are not clear. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that long-term low protein, low calorie intake and endurance exercise are associated with low concentrations of plasma growth factors and hormones that are linked to an increased risk of cancer. DESIGN: Plasma growth factors and hormones were evaluated in 21 sedentary subjects, who had been eating a low-protein, low-calorie diet for 4.4 +/- 2.8 y (x +",
    "The effect of a plant-based low-carbohydrate (\"Eco-Atkins\") diet on body weight and blood lipid concentrations in hyperlipidemic subjects.\tBACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. The effect of exchanging the animal proteins and fats for those of vegetable origin has not been tested. Our objective was to determine the effect on weight loss and LDL-C concentration of a low-carbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins from gluten, soy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and vegetable oils",
    "Flaxseed Supplementation (not Dietary Fat Restriction) Reduces Prostate Cancer Proliferation Rates in Men Presurgery\tBackground Prostate cancer affects one-out-of-six men during their lifetime. Dietary factors are postulated to influence the development and progression of prostate cancer. Low-fat diets and flaxseed supplementation may offer potentially protective strategies. Methods We undertook a multi-site, randomized controlled trial to test the effects of low-fat and/or flaxseed-supplemented diets on the biology of the prostate and other biomarkers. Prostate cancer patients (n=161) scheduled at least 21 days before prostatectomy were randomly assigned to one of the following arms: 1) control (usual diet); 2) flaxseed",

    "Manipulating antioxidant intake in asthma: a randomized controlled trial.\tBACKGROUND: Antioxidant-rich diets are associated with reduced asthma prevalence in epidemiologic studies. We previously showed that short-term manipulation of antioxidant defenses leads to changes in asthma outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a high-antioxidant diet compared with those of a low-antioxidant diet, with or without lycopene supplementation, in asthma. DESIGN: Asthmatic adults (n = 137) were randomly assigned to a high-antioxidant diet (5 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit daily; n = 46) or a low-antioxidant diet (\u22642 servings of vegetables and 1 serving",
    "Effectiveness of a soy-based compared with a traditional low-calorie diet on weight loss and lipid levels in overweight adults.\tOBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of a soy-based low-calorie diet on weight control, body composition, and blood lipid profiles compared with a traditional low-calorie diet. METHODS: Thirty obese adults (mean body mass index 29-30 kg/m(2)) were randomized to two groups. The soy-based low-calorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source, and the traditional low-calorie group consumed two-thirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200 kcal/d diet for",
    "Mediterranean and low-fat diets improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men.\tBACKGROUND: The regulatory function of the endothelium is altered in hypercholesterolemia, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients is affected by replacing a saturated fat-enriched diet with a low-fat, low-saturated fat diet (the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program stage 1 [NCEP-1] diet) or a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (such as that common in Mediterranean countries). DESIGN: Intervention dietary study with a baseline phase and two randomized crossover dietary periods. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Reina Sof\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba",
    "The effect of combining plant sterols, soy protein, viscous fibers, and almonds in treating hypercholesterolemia.\tReductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) result from diets containing almonds, or diets that are either low in saturated fat or high in viscous fibers, soy proteins, or plant sterols. We have therefore combined all of these interventions in a single diet (portfolio diet) to determine whether cholesterol reductions could be achieved of similar magnitude to those reported in recent statin trials which reduced cardiovascular events. Twenty-five hyperlipidemic subjects consumed either a portfolio diet (n=13), very low in saturated fat and high in plant sterols (1.2 g/1,000 kcal"
