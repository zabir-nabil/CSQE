    "Sure! Here is a passage addressing the question:\n\nWhile iodine is an essential micronutrient required by the body for proper thyroid function, it is important to note that both too much and too little iodine can have negative effects on health. Excessive iodine consumption can lead to a condition known as iodine toxicity, which can cause symptoms such as thyroid dysfunction, inflammation of the thyroid gland, and even thyroid cancer in some cases. On the other hand, inadequate iodine intake can result in iodine deficiency disorders like goiter and developmental delays. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a balance and ensure that our iodine intake falls within the recommended daily allowances to support optimal health and thyroid function.",
    "Both too much and too little iodine can have negative effects on the human body. Iodine is an essential mineral that is crucial for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland, which regulates metabolism and plays a role in growth and development. While iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders and health issues like goiter, too much iodine can also be harmful. Excessive iodine intake can disrupt thyroid function, leading to conditions such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is important to maintain a balanced intake of iodine to support overall health and well-being."

    "Preventing and arresting coronary atherosclerosis.\tThe good news about coronary atherosclerosis is that it takes an awful lot of plaque before symptoms of myocardial ischemia occur. The bad news is that despite the need for large quantities of plaque for symptoms to occur, nevertheless nearly half of us in the United States eventually have the necessary quantity. Atherosclerosis is infrequently hereditary in origin. Most of us get atherosclerosis because we consume too much fat, cholesterol, and calories. The consequence is an elevated ( > 150 mg/dl) serum total cholesterol level, and the higher the number is above 150, the greater is the quantity of plaque deposited in our arteries. If the serum total",
    "Too much of too little: xylitol, an unusual trigger of a chronic metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis.\tHomeopathic globules are frequently used in children as a first-line treatment. Most of these globules are coated with sugar substitutes like xylitol; these substitutes are known for their laxative effect. Our patient shows that consumption of globules coated with xylitol does not have only laxative effects. It may cause indeed considerable weight loss and life-threatening enteral bicarbonate loss by diarrhea when overdosed in an infant.",
    "Facing the facelessness of public health: what's the public got to do with it?\tDespite compelling statistics that show we could eliminate 80%of all heart disease and strokes, 90% of all diabetes, and 60% of all cancers with basic lifestyle changes, we have failed to motivate the public to make these changes and failed to motivate policy makers to make healthy choices the easiest choice. Dr. Katz suggests we have failed because we have focused too much on statistics and too little on passion. He implores all of us to tap into people's passion by connecting each of these statistics with a human story.",
    "Sodium and potassium intakes among US adults: NHANES 2003\u20132008\tBackground: The American Heart Association (AHA), Institute of Medicine (IOM), and US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans all recommend that Americans limit sodium intake and choose foods that contain potassium to decrease the risk of hypertension and other adverse health outcomes. Objective: We estimated the distributions of usual daily sodium and potassium intakes by sociodemographic and health characteristics relative to current recommendations. Design: We used 24-h dietary recalls and other data from 12,581 adults aged \u226520 y who participated in NHANES in 2003\u20132008. Estimates of sodium and potassium intakes were adjusted for within",
    "Too Much Sitting: The Population-Health Science of Sedentary Behavior\tEven when adults meet physical activity guidelines, sitting for prolonged periods can compromise metabolic health. TV time and objective-measurement studies show deleterious associations, and breaking up sedentary time is beneficial. Sitting time, TV time, and time sitting in automobiles increase premature mortality risk. Further evidence from prospective studies, intervention trials, and population-based behavioral studies is required.",
    "Sugar substitutes: Health controversy over perceived benefits\tSugar is an inseparable part of the food we consume. But too much sugar is not ideal for our teeth and waistline. There have been some controversial suggestions that excessive sugar may play an important role in certain degenerative diseases. So artificial sweeteners or artificially sweetened products continue to attract consumers. A sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. Some kind of health related side effects including carcinogenicity are",
    "Vegetarian diets: what do we know of their effects on common chronic diseases?\tA number of studies have evaluated the health of vegetarians. Others have studied the health effects of foods that are preferred or avoided by vegetarians. The purpose of this review is to look critically at the evidence on the health effects of vegetarian diets and to seek possible explanations where results appear to conflict. There is convincing evidence that vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease, largely explained by low LDL cholesterol, probable lower rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower prevalence of obesity. Overall, their cancer rates appear to be moderately lower than others living in the same communities, and",
    "Do all sedentary activities lead to weight gain: sleep does not.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the benefits of having a good night's sleep for body weight stability. RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental studies have shown that short-term partial sleep restriction decreases glucose tolerance, increases sympathetic tone, elevates cortisol concentrations, decreases the satiety hormone leptin, increases the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, and increases hunger and appetite. Short sleep duration might increase the risk of becoming obese, because it does not allow the recovery of a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control. Lack of sleep could also lead to weight gain and obesity by increasing the time available for eating and by making the",
    "Synthetic Food Colors and Neurobehavioral Hazards: The View from Environmental Health Research\tBackground: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year",
    "Possible therapy for ALS based on the cyanobacteria/BMAA hypothesis.\tAlthough the cyanobacteria/BMAA hypothesis of the cause of ALS and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases remains to be proven, it is not too early to ask whether treatment would be possible if the hypothesis were correct. This paper reviews the possible ways that chronic BMAA neurotoxicity could be prevented or treated."
