    "Heart disease is a serious health concern that can have significant impacts on an individual's well-being. Research indicates that the roots of heart disease may actually begin in childhood. Factors such as poor dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and even exposure to secondhand smoke at a young age can contribute to the development of heart disease later in life. Therefore, it is crucial for parents and caregivers to prioritize promoting a healthy lifestyle for children from a young age. Encouraging nutritious eating habits, regular physical activity, and creating a smoke-free environment are essential steps in preventing the early onset of heart disease. By making these proactive efforts, we can help protect the heart health of our children and set them on a path to a lifelong heart-healthy lifestyle.",
    "Recent research has brought to light a concerning finding that heart disease can have its roots in childhood. It was previously believed that heart disease was primarily a concern for older adults, but studies now suggest that the early stages of this condition can develop in childhood. Factors such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, and obesity during childhood can contribute to the development of heart disease later in life. This revelation underscores the importance of promoting healthy habits from a young age to prevent the onset of heart disease. By encouraging children to eat nutritious foods, engage in regular physical activity, and maintain a healthy weight, we can potentially reduce the risk of heart disease in adulthood. Early intervention and education about heart-healthy habits are crucial in combating this prevalent health issue."

    "Heart Disease Starts in Childhood Does childhood meat eating contribute to sex differences in risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in a developing population? A male epidemic of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) emerges with economic development. It has previously been hypothesised that this epidemic is due to nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex steroids, which lead to a more atherogenic body shape and lipid profile in boys but not girls. Atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses during adolescence and young adulthood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study previously reported risk scores to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in young individuals aged 15 to 34 years. Adrenarche is the increase in adrenal androgen (AA) production starting in childhood. The objective was to examine whether body composition and certain dietary intakes are associated with AA production in children after accounting for urinary indicators of major adrenarche-related steroidogenic enzymes.",

    "Does childhood meat eating contribute to sex differences in risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in a developing population?\tBACKGROUND: A male epidemic of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) emerges with economic development. It has previously been hypothesised that this epidemic is due to nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex steroids, which lead to a more atherogenic body shape and lipid profile in boys but not girls, without any sex-specific effects on glucose metabolism. This study tests this hypothesis by examining the association of childhood meat eating with IHD risk in a developing Chinese population. METHODS: Multivariable linear and censored regression was used in a cross-sectional study of 19,418 Chinese older (\u2265 50",
    "Reducing Childhood Obesity by Eliminating 100% Fruit Juice\tThe Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 presents an opportunity to change the nutritional quality of foods served in low-income childcare centers, including Head Start centers. Excessive fruit juice consumption is associated with increased risk for obesity. Moreover, there is recent scientific evidence that sucrose consumption without the corresponding fiber, as is commonly present in fruit juice, is associated with the metabolic syndrome, liver injury, and obesity. Given the increasing risk of obesity among preschool children, we recommend that the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Child and Adult Food Care Program, which manages the meal patterns in childcare centers such as Head Start",
    "Pathobiological determinants of atherosclerosis in youth risk scores are associated with early and advanced atherosclerosis.\tOBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses during adolescence and young adulthood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study previously reported risk scores to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in young individuals aged 15 to 34 years using the coronary heart disease risk factors (gender, age, serum lipoprotein concentrations, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycemia). In this study we investigated the relation of these risk scores to the early atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: We measured atherosclerotic lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery, and abdominal aorta and the coronary heart disease",
    "Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans.\tObesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells (adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and",
    "A systematic review of the effects of nuts on blood lipid profiles in humans.\tThe inverse association of nut consumption and risk markers of coronary heart disease (lipids) has sparked the interest of the scientific and lay community. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to investigate the effects of nuts on the lipid profile. Medline and Web of Science databases were searched from the start of the database to August 2004 and supplemented by cross-checking reference lists of relevant publications. Human intervention trials with the objective of investigating independent effects of nuts on lipid concentrations were included. From the literature search, 415 publications were screened and 23 studies were included. These",

    "Body fat and animal protein intakes are associated with adrenal androgen secretion in children.\tBACKGROUND: Adrenarche is the increase in adrenal androgen (AA) production starting in childhood. Until now, it has been unknown whether or not nutritional factors modulate adrenarche. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether body composition and certain dietary intakes are associated with AA production in children after accounting for urinary indicators of major adrenarche-related steroidogenic enzymes. DESIGN: Androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites were profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24-h urine samples of 137 healthy prepubertal children aged 3-12 y, for whom birth characteristics, growth velocity data, and 3-d weighed-",
    "COX-2 inhibitors: a story of greed, deception and death.\tIn 1999, drug manufacturers introduced a class of NSAIDs called COX-2 inhibitors or coxibs. The drugs were avidly promoted directly to the consumers and became bestsellers from the start. Arthritis sufferers were eager to take medications that eased joint pain with less risk of causing gastrointestinal pain, bleeding and other side-effects. In the year after their introduction, doctors wrote over 100 million prescriptions for celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx). Celebrex is the sixth best-selling drug, with sales of more than US$ 4 billion since its debut in 1999. Vioxx had sales of US$ 2.6 billion in 2001.",
