    "Apthous ulcers, also known as canker sores, have long puzzled both patients and healthcare professionals with their mysterious appearance and persistence. These painful sores can be small or large and often appear on the inside of the lips, cheeks, or tongue. For years, the exact cause of apthous ulcers has been uncertain, with factors such as genetics, immune system dysregulation, and viral infections being proposed as potential triggers.\n\nHowever, recent research has shed new light on the mystery of apthous ulcers. Studies have revealed that a combination of factors, including injury to the oral mucosa, stress, certain foods, and underlying health conditions, can contribute to the development of these troublesome ulcers. Additionally, it has been found that some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to developing apthous ulcers, making them more susceptible to these painful sores.\n\nBy understanding the various factors that can lead to the formation of apthous ulcers, healthcare providers are better equipped to advise patients on preventive measures and treatment options. From maintaining good oral hygiene to managing stress levels and identifying trigger foods, there are steps that individuals can take to reduce the frequency and severity of apthous ulcers. With ongoing research and increased awareness, the mystery of these painful sores is gradually being unraveled, offering hope for improved management and relief for those affected.",
    "Researchers have finally cracked the mystery behind apthous ulcers, a common and painful condition that affects many people. Through careful and extensive studies, scientists have discovered that apthous ulcers are primarily caused by an immune system response to certain triggers, such as stress, hormonal changes, or even certain foods. This breakthrough in understanding the underlying cause of apthous ulcers opens up new possibilities for more effective treatments and prevention strategies. Patients and healthcare providers can now work together to manage and alleviate the symptoms of apthous ulcers with a clearer understanding of how to address the root cause of this uncomfortable condition."

    "Apthous Ulcer Mystery Solved OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of serum antibodies to gliadin and to cow's milk proteins (CMP) using ELISA test, within patients who have recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU). RESULTS: The levels of serum antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were not significantly higher in patients with RAU in comparison with the controls. Gastroenterologists are often faced with the diagnostic problem of differentiating acute symptoms of ulcerative colitis from functional intestinal disorders. Bowel obsession syndrome (BOS) is an OCD-like, functional syndrome characterized by fear of fecal incontinence and compulsive behaviors of evacuation-checking.",

    "Maternal consumption of a docosahexaenoic acid-containing functional food during pregnancy: benefit for infant performance on problem-solving but n...\tBACKGROUND: There are few studies reporting on docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) supplementation during pregnancy and infant cognitive function. DHA supplementation in pregnancy and infant problem solving in the first year have not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that infants born to women who consumed a DHA-containing functional food during pregnancy would demonstrate better problem-solving abilities and recognition memory than would infants born to women who consumed the placebo during pregnancy. DESIGN: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, pregnant women consumed a",
    "Prevalence and incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers during treatment with vascular protective doses of aspirin.\tBACKGROUND: Aspirin is valuable for preventing vascular events, but information about ulcer frequency is necessary to inform risk-benefit decisions in individual patients. AIM: To determine ulcer prevalence and incidence in a population representative of those given aspirin therapy and evaluate risk predictors. METHODS: Patients taking aspirin 75-325 mg daily were recruited from four countries. Exclusions included use of gastroprotectant drugs or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We measured point prevalence of endoscopic ulcers, after quantitating dyspeptic symptoms. Incidence was assessed 3 months later in those eligible to continue (no baseline ulcer or reason for",
    "Turmeric (curcumin) remedies gastroprotective action\tThe purpose of this review is to summarize the pertinent literature published in the present era regarding the antiulcerogenic property of curcumin against the pathological changes in response to ulcer effectors (Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exogenous substances). The gastrointestinal problems caused by different etiologies was observed to be associated with the alterations of various physiologic parameters such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide synthase, lipid peroxidation, and secretion of excessive gastric acid. Gastrointestinal ulcer results probably due to imbalance between the aggressive and the defensive factors. In 80% of the cases, gastric ulcer is caused primarily due to",
    "Epidemiology of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastrointestinal injury.\tNonaspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently used drugs in many countries. Use of the majority of NSAIDs increases with age, primarily for symptoms associated with osteoarthritis and other chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Population-based studies have shown that, on any given day, 10-20% of elderly people (> or = 65 years old) have a current or recent NSAID prescription. Over a 6-month period in Alberta, Canada, 27% of elderly people were prescribed NSAIDs. Furthermore, in Tennessee (USA), 40% of elderly people received at least",
    "Natural and modified (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans in health promotion and disease alleviation.\tA number of polysaccharides with beta-glycosidic linkage are widespread in nature in a variety of sources. All have a common structure and the (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan backbone is essential. They have attracted attention over the years because of their bioactive and medicinal properties. In many cases their functional role is a mystery, in others it is well established. Because of their insoluble chemical nature, particulate (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans are not suitable for many medical applications. Various methods of changing or modifying the beta-D-glucan chemical structure and",
    "Evolution of Inflammatory Diseases\tThe association of inflammation with modern human diseases (e.g. obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer) remains an unsolved mystery of current biology and medicine. Inflammation is a protective response to noxious stimuli that unavoidably occurs at a cost to normal tissue function. This fundamental tradeoff between the cost and benefit of the inflammatory response has been optimized over evolutionary time for specific environmental conditions. Rapid change of the human environment due to niche construction outpaces genetic adaptation through natural selection, leading increasingly to a mismatch between the modern environment and selected traits. Consequently, multiple tradeoffs that affect human physiology are not optimized to the modern environment, leading to increased",
    "No Association of Coffee Consumption with Gastric Ulcer, Duodenal Ulcer, Reflux Esophagitis, and Non-Erosive Reflux Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study of 8,013 Healthy Subjects in Japan\tProbably due to caffeine-induced gastric acid secretion, negative effects of coffee upon various upper-gastrointestinal diseases have been precariously accepted, despite the inadequate epidemiological evidence. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of coffee consumption on four major acid-related diseases: gastric ulcer (GU), duodenal ulcer (DU), reflux esophagitis (RE), and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) based on the large-scale multivariate analysis. Of the 9,517 healthy adults, GU, DU",
    "When can we cure Crohn's?\tCrohn's disease is a life-long idiopathic inflammatory disease which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract and occasionally extra-intestinal organs. CD is thought to result from complex interactions between environmental factors, the gut microbes, and the genetic background and the immune system of the host. In the last decades research on these pathogenetic components, and especially on mucosal immunity, has led to the development of biologic agents and therapeutic strategies that have improved dramatically the treatment of CD but we are still far away from curing the disease. If there is a treatment for CD that will probably evolve through methodical steps towards integrating research on all the components involved",

    "Bowel obsession syndrome in a patient with ulcerative colitis.\tGastroenterologists are often faced with the diagnostic problem of differentiating acute symptoms of ulcerative colitis from functional intestinal disorders. Bowel obsession syndrome (BOS) is an OCD-like, functional syndrome characterized by fear of fecal incontinence and compulsive behaviors of evacuation-checking. Only sparse case studies on treatment of BOS with antidepressants have been published. This is the first study on successful psychotherapy of a male patient with ulcerative colitis overlapping functional bowel symptoms and marked symptoms of BOS. Clinical recognition of BOS may help clinicians in differential diagnosis, prevent unnecessary investigations, and give patients the most appropriate treatment."
