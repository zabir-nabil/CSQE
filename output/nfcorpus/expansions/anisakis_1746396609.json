    "Anisakis is a genus of parasitic nematode worms that are commonly found in marine fish and squid. These worms can be transmitted to humans who consume raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with Anisakis larvae. In humans, Anisakis infection can lead to a condition known as anisakiasis, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, allergic reactions or intestinal blockages. It is important to properly freeze or cook seafood to kill any potential Anisakis larvae and reduce the risk of infection when consuming raw or undercooked fish or squid.",
    "Anisakis is a type of parasitic worm commonly found in marine fish, particularly in species like cod, haddock, and mackerel. When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, they can unknowingly ingest the Anisakis larvae, which can cause an infection known as anisakiasis. Symptoms of anisakiasis may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and even allergic reactions. It is important to properly cook fish and seafood to kill any potential parasites, as well as to ensure proper handling and storage to prevent contamination. If you suspect you may have ingested Anisakis larvae or are experiencing symptoms of anisakiasis, it is recommended to seek medical attention promptly for diagnosis and treatment."

    "Anisakis simplex: from Obscure Infectious Worm to Inducer of Immune Hypersensitivity\tSummary: Infection of humans with the nematode worm parasite Anisakis simplex was first described in the 1960s in association with the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. During the 1990s it was realized that even the ingestion of dead worms in food fish can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, that these may be more prevalent than infection itself, and that this outcome could be associated with food preparations previously considered safe. Not only may allergic symptoms arise from infection by the parasites (\u201cgastroallergic anisakiasis\u201d), but true anaphylactic reactions can also occur following exposure to allergens from dead worms by food-borne, airborne, or",
    "Anisakis simplex allergy after eating chicken meat.\tBACKGROUND: Allergic reactions to food can be produced by contaminants that induce sensitization. Among these, Anisakis simplex can cause seafood infestation, and allergic symptoms (urticaria-angioedema, anaphylaxis, and asthma) can follow the eating or handling of affected fish. Although seafood is the principal source of human infections by this parasite, we have found allergic symptoms in 8 patients previously diagnosed as having A simplex sensitization after they ate chicken meat. Chicken feed usually has a high proportion of fishmeal, which might possibly be contaminated by this nematode. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether parasite proteins present in chicken meat could",
    "Evaluation of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of anisakis simplex parasite as a food-borne allergen source in seafo...\tAnisakis simplex has been recognized as an important cause of disease in humans and as a food-borne allergen source. Actually, this food-borne parasite was recently identified as an emerging food safety risk. An A. simplex -specific primer-probe system based on a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection assay has been successfully optimized and validated with seafood samples. In addition, a DNA extraction procedure has been optimized to detect the presence of the nematode in food samples. The assay is a very reliable",
    "Anisakis simplex hypersensitivity is associated with chronic urticaria in endemic areas.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic urticaria (CU) may affect up to 1% of the general population. Anisakis simplex hypersensitivity is frequent in areas where raw fish is consumed and A. simplex allergy represents a relevant cause of acute urticaria. We assessed the possible association between CU and A. simplex sensitization in an area where marinated fish is very frequently eaten. METHODS: A thorough history of CU was sought in 919 adults seen at the Allergy Center, Bari. CU patients and 187 controls underwent skin-prick testing with a commercial extract of A. simplex, and reactors were recommended a 6-month raw-fish-free",
    "Anisakiasis, an underestimated infection: effect on intestinal permeability of Anisakis simplex-sensitized patients.\tAnisakis simplex is a parasite that, if present in uncooked and contaminated saltwater fish, can invade the human gut. Two different clinical situations are recognized: the first, known as a gastrointestinal disease, varying from an asymptomatic episode to vomiting and diarrhea, and the second, classified as an adverse reaction to food, characterized by a wide spectrum of allergic reactions like rhinitis, conjunctivitis, or even anaphylaxis causing hypotension and/or shock.
