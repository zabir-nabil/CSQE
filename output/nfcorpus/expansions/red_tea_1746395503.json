    "red tea Previous studies indicated that the consumption of polyphenol-rich foods (eg, cocoa, tea, and red wine) may induce beneficial changes in pathways related to cardiovascular health. Whether the consumption of berries has similar effects is unknown. There is growing interest in the potential health benefits of tea, including the antimutagenic properties. Four varieties of white tea, which represent the least processed form of tea, were shown to have marked antimutagenic activity in the Salmonella assay. We studied the vascular effects of tea, with or without milk, in humans and elucidated the impact of individual milk proteins in cell culture experiments, with isolated rat aortic rings and by HPLC analysis. A total of 16 healthy female volunteers consumed either 500 mL of freshly brewed black tea, black tea with 10% skimmed milk, or boiled water as control.",

    "Development and validation of an algorithm to establish a total antioxidant capacity database of the US diet.\tEstimation of total antioxidant intake is the first step to investigate the protective effects of antioxidants on oxidative stress-mediated disease. The present study was designed to develop an algorithm to estimate total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the US diet. TAC of individual antioxidants and 50 popular antioxidant-rich food items in the US diet were determined by 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Theoretical TAC of foods was calculated as the sum of individual antioxidant capacities of compounds. The top 10 TAC food",
    "Diet and gallbladder cancer: a case-control study.\tCancer of the gallbladder is rare but fatal, and has an unusual geographic and demographic distribution. Gallstones and obesity have been suggested as possible risk factors. As diet is known to influence both these factors, we carried out the present study to evaluate the possible role of diet in gallbladder carcinogenesis. A case-control study involving 64 newly diagnosed cases of gallbladder cancer and 101 cases of gallstones was carried out. The dietary evaluation was carried out by the dietary recall method based on a preset questionnaire developed specifically for the present study, keeping in mind the common dietary habits prevailing in this part of the world.",
    "Effect of spiced food on metabolic rate.\tSince the time of Lavoisier it has been known that the ingestion of food in animals and man produces an increase in oxygen consumption. This increase in metabolic rate was originally called 'specific dynamic action' (SDA) and is now widely referred to as the thermic effect (TE) of food or diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) (Rothwell & Stock, 1981). Much of the early work on the thermic effect was confined to the type and amount of food, notably the macronutrients--proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Later, it was shown that certain minor constituents of the diet such as caffeine and associated methylxanthines",
    "Habitual intake of dietary flavonoids and risk of Parkinson disease\tObjective: To prospectively examine whether higher intakes of total flavonoids and their subclasses (flavanones, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavones, and polymers) were associated with a lower risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: In the current analysis, we included 49,281 men in the Health Professional Follow-up Study and 80,336 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Five major sources of flavonoid-rich foods (tea, berry fruits, apples, red wine, and orange/orange juice) were also examined. Flavonoid intake was assessed using an updated food composition database and a validated food frequency",
    "Favorable effects of berry consumption on platelet function, blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol.\tBACKGROUND: Berries are a particularly rich source of polyphenols. They also contain other bioactive substances, such as vitamin C. Previous studies indicated that the consumption of polyphenol-rich foods (eg, cocoa, tea, and red wine) may induce beneficial changes in pathways related to cardiovascular health. Whether the consumption of berries has similar effects is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effects of berry consumption on hemostatic function, serum lipids, and blood pressure (BP). DESIGN: Middle-aged unmedicated subjects (n = 72) with cardiovascular risk factors consumed moderate amounts of",
    "Dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women.\tOBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Several studies have examined the role of single nutrients and food groups in breast cancer pathogenesis but fewer investigations have addressed the role of dietary patterns. Our main objective was to identify the relationship between major dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among Iranian women. DESIGN: Hospital-based case-control study. SETTING: Shohada Teaching Hospital, Tehran, Iran. SUBJECTS: Overall, 100 female patients aged 30-65 years with breast cancer and 174 female hospital controls were included in the present study. Dietary intake was assessed using a valid and reliable",
    "Who uses multivitamins? A cross-sectional study in the Physicians' Health Study.\tPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported multivitamin use in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) cohort and its association with various lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors to improve our understanding of who tends to use multivitamins. METHODS: Among 18,040 middle-aged and older men, information on lifestyle and clinical factors was collected from a baseline enrollment questionnaire, and supplement use and dietary factors were assessed through a food-frequency questionnaire. Four categories of multivitamin use were considered: (1) no supplement use, (2) use of",
    "Potent antimutagenic activity of white tea in comparison with green tea in the Salmonella assay.\tThere is growing interest in the potential health benefits of tea, including the antimutagenic properties. Four varieties of white tea, which represent the least processed form of tea, were shown to have marked antimutagenic activity in the Salmonella assay, particularly in the presence of S9. The most active of these teas, Exotica China white tea, was significantly more effective than Premium green tea (Dragonwell special grade) against 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and four other heterocyclic amine mutagens, namely 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H",
    "Erosive potentials of brewed teas.\tPURPOSE: To measure the pH, titratable acidity, fluoride concentration and erosive potential of brewed teas. METHODS: Bag teas were purchased to represent black, green, citrus, fruity, and floral tea flavors from Tulsi, Bigelow, HyVee, Tazo, and Yogi brands and brewed (1 bag/240 ml) in boiling water for 3 minutes. The pH, titratable acidity, and fluoride concentrations were measured. Following these measurements, a representative tea from each flavor was selected for investigation of erosion potential. Six extracted human molars were randomly assigned to each tea. Teeth were painted with fingernail polish to expose a 1 x 4 mm window and",
    "Addition of milk prevents vascular protective effects of tea.\tAIMS: Experimental and clinical studies indicate that tea exerts protection against cardiovascular diseases. However, a question of much debate is whether addition of milk modifies the biological activities of tea. We studied the vascular effects of tea, with or without milk, in humans and elucidated the impact of individual milk proteins in cell culture experiments, with isolated rat aortic rings and by HPLC analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 16 healthy female volunteers consumed either 500 mL of freshly brewed black tea, black tea with 10% skimmed milk, or boiled water as control.
