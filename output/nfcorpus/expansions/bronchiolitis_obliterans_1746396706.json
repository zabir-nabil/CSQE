    "Bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as obliterative bronchiolitis, is a rare but serious lung condition characterized by inflammation and scarring of the small airways in the lungs, known as bronchioles. This inflammation and scarring can lead to narrowing or blockage of the airways, making it difficult for air to flow in and out of the lungs. Symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans may include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and fatigue. The condition can be caused by various factors, including exposure to toxic chemicals or fumes, certain infections, organ transplant rejection, and autoimmune diseases. Treatment for bronchiolitis obliterans may involve managing symptoms, addressing underlying causes, and sometimes lung transplant in severe cases. Early diagnosis and intervention are key in managing the condition and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.",
    "Bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as popcorn lung, is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that affects the small airways in the lungs. This condition is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bronchioles, leading to narrowing or blockage of the airways. As a result, individuals with bronchiolitis obliterans may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.\n\nThere are various causes of bronchiolitis obliterans, including exposure to toxic fumes or chemicals, respiratory infections, and certain autoimmune conditions. One well-known cause of bronchiolitis obliterans is inhalation of diacetyl, a chemical often used in flavoring agents such as those used in popcorn production, hence the nickname \"popcorn lung.\"\n\nDiagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans typically involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and pulmonary function tests. Treatment options may include respiratory therapies, medications to reduce inflammation, and in severe cases, lung transplantation. It is important for individuals at risk of bronchiolitis obliterans, such as those working in certain industries with chemical exposures, to take precautions to minimize their risk and seek medical attention if they experience respiratory symptoms."

    "Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) after thoracic radiotherapy for breast carcinoma\tCommon complications of thoracic radiotherapy include esophagitis and radiation pneumonitis. However, it is important to be aware of uncommon post-radiotherapy complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). We report on two patients with carcinoma of the breast who developed an interstitial lung disease consistent with BOOP. BOOP responds to treatment with corticosteroids and the prognosis is generally good despite of the need for long-term administration of corticosteroids as relapses can occur during tapering of steroids. This report provides guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of patients with pulmonary infiltrates after radiotherapy.",

However, there are no published reports of lung disease among BFMP consumers. We present a case series of three BFMP consumers with biopsy-confirmed BO. We review data relating to consumer exposures, estimate case exposures, and compare them to diacetyl-containing flavoring-exposed manufacturing workers with lung disease. These consumer cases' exposure levels are comparable to those that caused disease in workers. We",
    "Popcorn-worker lung caused by corporate and regulatory negligence: an avoidable tragedy.\tDiacetyl-containing butter flavor was identified as the cause of an outbreak of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and other lung diseases in popcorn-plant workers. Litigation documents show that the outbreak was both predictable and preventable. The industry trade organization was aware of BO cases in workers at butter-flavoring and popcorn-manufacturing plants but often failed to implement industrial hygiene improvements and actively hid pertinent warning information. Due to weaknesses in the organization and mandates of regulatory bodies, organizations such as NIOSH, OSHA, the FDA, particularly the \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) system, and"
