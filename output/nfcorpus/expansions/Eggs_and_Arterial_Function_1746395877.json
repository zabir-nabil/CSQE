    "Recent studies have explored the potential impact of eggs on arterial function. Eggs have been a topic of debate due to their cholesterol content, with concerns about their effect on heart health. However, research suggests that moderate egg consumption may not have a detrimental effect on arterial function in healthy individuals. In fact, eggs are a good source of nutrients such as protein and antioxidants that can benefit cardiovascular health. It is important to consider overall dietary patterns and individual health conditions when determining the role of eggs in heart health. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between egg consumption and arterial function.",
    "Eggs have long been considered a controversial food due to their cholesterol content. However, recent research suggests that eggs may not have as significant an impact on heart health as previously thought. In fact, studies have shown that consuming eggs in moderation can be part of a healthy diet and may even have potential benefits for arterial function.\n\nOne study published in the journal Heart found that eating up to one egg per day was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease or stroke. Additionally, eggs are a good source of nutrients such as protein and various vitamins and minerals that are important for overall health.\n\nFurthermore, eggs contain compounds like lutein and zeaxanthin, which have antioxidant properties and may help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation, two factors that can contribute to arterial damage and dysfunction.\n\nWhile moderation is key, incorporating eggs into a balanced diet, along with other heart-healthy foods, may not only be safe but could also have potential benefits for arterial function. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist to determine how eggs can fit into an individual's overall dietary plan for optimal heart health."

    "Egg consumption and endothelial function: a randomized controlled crossover trial.\tBACKGROUND: Because of egg cholesterol content, reduction in egg consumption is generally recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. Recently, however, evidence has been accumulating to suggest that dietary cholesterol is less relevant to cardiovascular risk than dietary saturated fat. This randomized controlled crossover trial was conducted to determine the effects of egg ingestion on endothelial function, a reliable index of cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Forty-nine healthy adults (mean age 56 years, 40% females) underwent a baseline brachial artery reactivity study (BARS), and were assigned to two eggs or oats daily for 6 weeks in random sequence with",
    "Daily egg consumption in hyperlipidemic adults - Effects on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk\tBackground Limiting consumption of eggs, which are high in cholesterol, is generally recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. However, recent evidence suggests that dietary cholesterol has limited influence on serum cholesterol or cardiac risk. Objective To assess the effects of egg consumption on endothelial function and serum lipids in hyperlipidemic adults. Methods Randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 40 hyperlipidemic adults (24 women, 16 men; average age = 59.9 \u00b1 9.6 years; weight = 76.3 \u00b1 21.8 kilograms; total cholesterol = 244 \u00b1 24 mg/dL). In the acute phase, participants were randomly assigned to",
    "Egg yolk consumption and carotid plaque.\tBACKGROUND: Increasingly the potential harm from high cholesterol intake, and specifically from egg yolks, is considered insignificant. We therefore assessed total plaque area (TPA) in patients attending Canadian vascular prevention clinics to determine if the atherosclerosis burden, as a marker of arterial damage, was related to egg intake. To provide perspective on the magnitude of the effect, we also analysed the effect of smoking (pack-years). METHODS: Consecutive patients attending vascular prevention clinics at University Hospital had baseline measurement of TPA by duplex ultrasound, and filled out questionnaires regarding their lifestyle and medications, including pack-years of smoking, and the number",
    "Arterial function of carotid and brachial arteries in postmenopausal vegetarians\tBackground: Vegetarianism is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies of arterial function in vegetarians are limited. Methods: This study investigated arterial function in vegetarianism by comparing 49 healthy postmenopausal vegetarians with 41 age-matched omnivores. The arterial function of the common carotid artery was assessed by carotid duplex, while the pulse dynamics method was used to measure brachial artery distensibility (BAD), compliance (BAC), and resistance (BAR). Fasting blood levels of glucose, lipids, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 were also measured.",
    "Dietary cholesterol and egg yolks: Not for patients at risk of vascular disease\tA widespread misconception has been developing among the Canadian public and among physicians. It is increasingly believed that consumption of dietary cholesterol and egg yolks is harmless. There are good reasons for long-standing recommendations that dietary cholesterol should be limited to less than 200 mg/day; a single large egg yolk contains approximately 275 mg of cholesterol (more than a day\u2019s worth of cholesterol). Although some studies showed no harm from consumption of eggs in healthy people, this outcome may have been due to lack of power to detect clinically relevant increases in a low-risk population. Moreover, the",
    "Brachial artery ultrasound: a noninvasive tool in the assessment of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.\tIn recent years, endothelial dysfunction has been identified as an early feature of atherosclerosis. Endothelial function can be measured noninvasively by using brachial artery ultrasound. A variety of factors associated with atherosclerosis also impair endothelial function. Some of these factors are lipoproteins such as various forms of low-density lipoproteins, postprandial chylomicron remnants, fasting triglyceride-rich particles, and free fatty acids. A high-fat diet also has an adverse effect on endothelial function. Several interventions can improve endothelial function and, at the same time, reduce cardiovascular events. Measuring endothelial function may eventually serve as a useful",
    "The acute effect of green tea consumption on endothelial function in healthy individuals.\tBACKGROUND: Tea consumption is associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery is related to coronary endothelial function and it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. Black tea has a beneficial effect on endothelial function; the effect, however, of green tea on brachial artery reactivity has not been defined yet. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 14 healthy individuals (age 30+/-3 years) with no cardiovascular risk factors except from smoking (50%) on three separate occasions on which they took: (a) 6 g of green tea, (b)",
    "Impairment of endothelial function--a possible mechanism for atherosclerosis of a high-fat meal intake.\tINTRODUCTION: Endothelial dysfunction is known to occur in patients with coronary artery disease. Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive technique for the assessment of endothelial function. The objective of the study was to use the above method to evaluate the pathophysiology of high-fat (HF) intake on endothelial function in a local population. A popular local dish \"nasi-lemak\", a source of high saturated fat content from coconut milk, was chosen to represent a local high-fat meal (LHF). In addition, the",
    "Improvement of endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation after a single LDL apheresis in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\tThe purpose of this study was to determine whether a single LDL apheresis would improve impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of the coronary artery in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, and human studies using cholesterol-lowering drugs indicate that endothelial function in the coronary arteries improves with reduction of serum LDL cholesterol over 6 to 12 months. The internal diameter of the left coronary artery and the coronary blood flow were measured by intracoronary Doppler-wire measurement and quantitative angiography before and immediately after a single LDL apheresis in a population of 15 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
