    "There is ongoing research and debate regarding the potential relationship between BPA (bisphenol A) plastic and male sexual dysfunction. BPA is a chemical compound found in some plastics used in food and beverage containers, among other products. Some studies suggest that exposure to BPA may disrupt hormone levels in the body, including testosterone, which could potentially impact male sexual function.\n\nHowever, the evidence linking BPA exposure to male sexual dysfunction is not conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand any potential risks. It is important to note that many factors can contribute to sexual dysfunction in men, including lifestyle choices, underlying health conditions, and psychological factors.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, individuals concerned about BPA exposure can take steps to reduce their intake by avoiding plastic containers with recycling codes 3 or 7, opting for BPA-free products, and minimizing the use of plastics in food and beverage storage. Consulting with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and addressing any sexual dysfunction concerns is also recommended.",
    "Research studies have investigated the potential link between BPA plastic and male sexual dysfunction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used in the production of plastics and can leach into food and beverages stored in containers made with BPA. Some animal studies suggest that BPA exposure may disrupt hormone levels, including testosterone, which could potentially lead to sexual dysfunction in males.\n\nWhile the research on this topic is ongoing, it is important to note that human studies have produced mixed results. Some studies have found associations between BPA exposure and male sexual dysfunction, such as decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, while others have not observed a clear link.\n\nTo reduce potential exposure to BPA, individuals can opt for BPA-free products, avoid microwaving plastic containers, and limit consumption of canned foods. Overall, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between BPA plastic and male sexual dysfunction, but taking precautions to minimize exposure to BPA is a prudent choice for overall health and well-being."

    "BPA Plastic and Male Sexual Dysfunction Bisphenol A (BPA) is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and male sexual dysfunction in exposed workers. BPA is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human body. Male sexual dysfunction was measured in 4 domains using 7 indices. Male reproductive disorders that are of interest from an environmental point of view include sexual dysfunction.",
    "BPA Plastic and Male Sexual Dysfunction, Food is a major exposure source. We know of no studies reporting BPA in U.S. fresh food, canned food, and food in plastic packaging in peer-reviewed journals. BPA is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and male sexual dysfunction in exposed workers. BPA is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human body. Male sexual dysfunction was ascertained using standard male sexual function inventories. Male reproductive disorders that are of interest from an environmental point of view include sexual dysfunction. The male germ line is one of the most sensitive tissues to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation, radiant heat and a number of known toxicants."

    "Bisphenol A (BPA) in U.S. food.\tBisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used for lining metal cans and in polycarbonate plastics, such as baby bottles. In rodents, BPA is associated with early sexual maturation, altered behavior, and effects on prostate and mammary glands. In humans, BPA is associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and male sexual dysfunction in exposed workers. Food is a major exposure source. We know of no studies reporting BPA in U.S. fresh food, canned food, and food in plastic packaging in peer reviewed journals. We measured BPA levels in 105 fresh and canned foods, foods sold in plastic packaging, and in cat and",
    "Relationship between urine bisphenol-A level and declining male sexual function.\tThe adverse effect of bisphenol-A (BPA) on the male reproductive system observed in animal studies has not been well examined in human populations. BPA is potentially a serious public health problem because of its widely detected presence in the human body. This study was conducted among 427 male workers in regions where high levels of BPA exposure existed. All participants provided urine samples, which were tested for BPA concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. Male sexual dysfunction was ascertained using standard male sexual function inventories. Male sexual dysfunction was measured in 4 domains using 7 indices. After controlling for potential confounders using",
    "Male sexuality and cardiovascular risk. A cohort study in patients with erectile dysfunction.\tINTRODUCTION: Although penile blood flow (PBF) has been recommended as an additional diagnostic test in identifying erectile dysfunction (ED) patients at risk for latent cardiovascular disease, no study has ever assessed the possible association of PBF and the relational component of sexual function with incident major cardiovascular events (MACE). AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate whether severity of ED, PBF, and other factors related to a couple's relationship predict incident MACE. METHODS: A consecutive series of 1,687 patients was studied. Different clinical, biochemical, and instrumental (penile flow at color Doppler",
    "Evaluation of Crocus sativus L. (saffron) on male erectile dysfunction: a pilot study.\tIn this study, the effect of Crocus sativus (saffron) was studied on male erectile dysfunction (ED). Twenty male patients with ED were followed for ten days in which each morning they took a tablet containing 200mg of saffron. Patients underwent the nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) test and the international index of erectile function questionnaire (IIEF-15) at the start of the treatment and at the end of the ten days. After the ten days of taking saffron there was a statistically significant improvement in tip rigidity and tip tumescence as well as base rigidity and base tumescence.",
    "Lifestyle/dietary recommendations for erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.\tSexual problems are diffuse in both genders. Although epidemiologic evidence seems to support a role for lifestyle factors in erectile dysfunction, limited data are available suggesting the treatment of underlying risk factors may improve erectile dysfunction. The results are sparse regarding associations between lifestyle factors and female sexual dysfunction, and conclusions regarding influence of healthy behaviors on female sexual dysfunction cannot be made before more studies have been performed. Beyond the specific effects on sexual dysfunctions in men and women, adoption of these measures promotes a healthier life and increased well-being, which may help reduce the burden of sexual dysfunction.

    "Maca (L. meyenii) for improving sexual function: a systematic review\tBackground Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is an Andean plant of the brassica (mustard) family. Preparations from maca root have been reported to improve sexual function. The aim of this review was to assess the clinical evidence for or against the effectiveness of the maca plant as a treatment for sexual dysfunction. Methods We searched 17 databases from their inception to April 2010 and included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of any type of maca compared to a placebo for the treatment of healthy people or human patients with sexual dysfunction. The risk of bias for each study was assessed using Cochrane criteria, and statistical",
    "Association between chronic periodontitis and vasculogenic erectile dysfunction.\tBACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) and chronic periodontitis (CP) share common risk factors. There is only one report on the association between ED and CP. Thus, the aim of this study is to find the association between vasculogenic ED and CP. METHODS: A total of 70 patients (mean age: 35.3 \u00b1 3.64 years) clinically diagnosed with ED were included in the study. They were given the Sexual Health Inventory for Men Questionnaire and subjected to colored penile Doppler ultrasound. Periodontal parameters of probing depth and periodontal attachment level were recorded. Five patients with ED and CP were selected randomly for cardiac color Doppler",
    "Male reproductive organs are at risk from environmental hazards\tMale reproductive disorders that are of interest from an environmental point of view include sexual dysfunction, infertility, cryptorchidism, hypospadias and testicular cancer. Several reports suggest declining sperm counts and increase of these reproductive disorders in some areas during some time periods past 50 years. Except for testicular cancer this evidence is circumstantial and needs cautious interpretation. However, the male germ line is one of the most sensitive tissues to the damaging effects of ionizing radiation, radiant heat and a number of known toxicants. So far occupational hazards are the best documented risk factors for impaired male reproductive function and include physical exposures (radiant heat, ionizing radiation,",
    "Bisphenol a in canned food products from canadian markets.\tA method based on solid phase extraction followed by derivatization and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was validated for the determination of bisphenol A (BPA) in canned food products. This method was used to analyze 78 canned food products for BPA.
