    "America's obesity problem can be attributed to a combination of various factors. One major driving force is the prevalence of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods that are often cheap and readily available. The rise of fast food chains and convenience stores has made unhealthy options more convenient than ever before.\n\nAdditionally, sedentary lifestyles have become increasingly common, with many people spending large portions of their day sitting at desks or in front of screens. Lack of physical activity, coupled with easy access to high-calorie foods, creates a perfect storm for weight gain.\n\nSocial and economic factors also play a role in America's obesity epidemic. Food deserts, or areas with limited access to affordable, healthy food options, make it difficult for individuals to make nutritious choices. Furthermore, income disparities can impact the ability of some individuals to afford healthy food or participate in physical activities like gym memberships or sports leagues.\n\nCultural attitudes towards food and body image can also contribute to the obesity problem. Portion sizes have increased drastically over the years, and food marketing often promotes unhealthy options as desirable choices.\n\nIn order to address America's obesity problem, a multi-faceted approach is needed. This could include promoting access to affordable and nutritious foods, encouraging physical activity, and shifting societal norms around food and body image. Education and awareness campaigns can also play a key role in helping individuals make healthier choices for themselves and their families.",
    "America's obesity problem stems from a complex combination of factors that have gradually contributed to the widespread issue. One key driver is the prevalence of unhealthy, processed foods that are high in sugar, fat, and calories, making them easily accessible and often more affordable than healthier alternatives. The rise of fast food chains and convenience foods has also led to a shift towards more sedentary lifestyles, where physical activity is decreasing while calorie intake remains high. Additionally, environmental and societal factors such as food marketing, portion sizes, and lack of access to fresh, nutritious foods in certain communities play a role in promoting unhealthy eating habits. Furthermore, increasing screen time and technology usage have led to a decrease in active leisure activities, further exacerbating the problem. To address America's obesity issue, a holistic approach involving education, policy changes, food industry regulations, and promoting a culture of wellness and physical activity is essential."

    "Fructose: It\u2019s \u201cAlcohol Without the Buzz\u201d\tWhat do the Atkins Diet and the traditional Japanese diet have in common? The Atkins Diet is low in carbohydrate and usually high in fat; the Japanese diet is high in carbohydrate and usually low in fat. Yet both work to promote weight loss. One commonality of both diets is that they both eliminate the monosaccharide fructose. Sucrose (table sugar) and its synthetic sister high fructose corn syrup consist of 2 molecules, glucose and fructose. Glucose is the molecule that when polymerized forms starch, which has a high glycemic index, generates an insulin response, and is not particularly sweet. Fructose is found in fruit",
    "Physical activity energy expenditure has not declined since the 1980s and matches energy expenditures of wild mammals.\tOBJECTIVE: Obesity results from protracted energy imbalance. Whether this comprises excessive energy intake, lowered physical activity or both, remains disputed. DESIGN: Physical activity energy expenditure, evaluated in three different ways from daily energy expenditure (DEE) measured using doubly labelled water, was examined for trends over time. Data included subjects in Europe (Maastricht, the Netherlands) and North America extending back to the 1980s. These data were compared with measures from the third world, and measures made on wild terrestrial mammals. RESULTS: Physical activity expenditure in Europe (residual of the regression of",
    "Clostridium difficile infection in humans and piglets: a 'One Health' opportunity.\tClostridium difficile causes infectious diarrhoea in humans and animals. It has been found in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal pigs, horses and cattle, suggesting a potential reservoir for human insection, and in 20-40\u00a0% of meat products in Canada and the USA, suggesting the possibility, albeit not proven, of food-borne transmission. Although it is not yet completely clear, it is likely that excessive antimicrobial exposure is driving the establishment of C. difficile in animals, in a manner analogous to human infection, rather than the organism just being normal flora of the animal gastrointestinal tract.",
    "The Preventable Causes of Death in the United States: Comparative Risk Assessment of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Metabolic Risk Factors\tBackground Knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight\u2013obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol",
    "The marketing of dietary supplements in North America: the emperor is (almost) naked.\tBACKGROUND: Many different dietary supplements are being sold in North America. The quality of the evidence supporting their efficacy covers a wide spectrum: Some are based on solid science (such as vitamin D and fish oil), whereas with most supplements there is little or no supporting evidence. Types of supplements commonly sold include exotic fruit juices (such as goji juice) and single herbs or mixture of herbs. Common claims made in support of particular supplements are that they are rich in antioxidants, induce detoxification, stimulate the immune system, and cause weight loss. Supplements are commonly sold",
    "Brain PET imaging in obesity and food addiction: current evidence and hypothesis.\tThe ongoing epidemics of obesity is one main health concern of the present time. Overeating in some obese individuals shares similarities with the loss of control and compulsive behavior observed in drug-addicted subjects, suggesting that obesity may involve food addiction. Here, we review the contributions provided by the use of positron emission tomography to the current understanding of the cerebral control of obesity and food intake in humans. The available studies have shown that multiple areas in the brain are involved with the reward properties of food, such as prefrontal, orbitofrontal, somatosensory cortices, insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and",
    "The Perils of Ignoring History: Big Tobacco Played Dirty and Millions Died. How Similar Is Big Food?\tContext: In 1954 the tobacco industry paid to publish the \u201cFrank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\u201d in hundreds of U.S. newspapers. It stated that the public's health was the industry's concern above all others and promised a variety of good-faith changes. What followed were decades of deceit and actions that cost millions of lives. In the hope that the food history will be written differently, this article both highlights important lessons that can be learned from the tobacco experience and recommends actions for the food industry. Methods: A review and analysis of empirical and historical",
    "Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of the gastrointestinal tract\tDietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (1012) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which",
    "The deadly quartet. Upper-body obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension.\tThe contribution of obesity to cardiovascular risk has not been adequately appreciated because of a failure to recognize the involvement of upper-body predominance of body weight with hypertension, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia even in the absence of significant overall obesity. This article examines the evidence that upper-body obesity, as usually induced by caloric excess in the presence of androgens, mediates these problems by way of hyperinsulinemia. Because of these interrelationships, there is a need to identify and prevent upper-body obesity or, failing that, to provide therapies that will control the associated problems without aggravating hyperinsulinemia.",
    "Organic food: buying more safety or just peace of mind? A critical review of the literature.\tConsumer concern over the quality and safety of conventional food has intensified in recent years, and primarily drives the increasing demand for organically grown food, which is perceived as healthier and safer. Relevant scientific evidence, however, is scarce, while anecdotal reports abound. Although there is an urgent need for information related to health benefits and/or hazards of food products of both origins, generalized conclusions remain tentative in the absence of adequate comparative data. Organic fruits and vegetables can be expected to contain fewer agrochemical residues than conventionally grown alternatives; yet, the significance of this difference is questionable"
