    "When doctors were named a leading killer, the response from the medical community was one of shock and introspection. Rather than becoming defensive, many doctors took the opportunity to reflect on their practices and strive for improvements in patient care. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, medical professionals began implementing new protocols, conducting more rigorous training, and placing a greater emphasis on patient safety. Instead of viewing the criticism as an attack, doctors saw it as a call to action to do better and prioritize the well-being of their patients above all else. Through collaboration, education, and a commitment to continuous improvement, doctors worked diligently to address the concerns raised and rebuild trust with the public. The response from doctors to being named a leading killer exemplifies their dedication to the profession and their unwavering commitment to providing the best possible care to those in need.",
    "When doctors were named as a leading killer, their response was a mix of shock, disbelief, and introspection. Many in the medical community were taken aback by the accusation, feeling that their primary role was to heal and save lives. Others recognized the potential for medical errors and complications to contribute to patient harm, leading them to reflect on ways to improve treatment outcomes and patient safety measures. Some doctors took the criticism as a call to action, prompting them to take a closer look at their own practices and make necessary adjustments to prevent avoidable harm in the future. Overall, the revelation of doctors being labeled as a leading killer sparked a necessary conversation within the medical community about accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement in patient care."

    "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor in inflammatory bowel disease: linking the environment to disease pathogenesis.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by a large number of environmental agents, modulates the activity of immune and nonimmune cells in the gut, and may represent an important link between the environment and the immune perturbations which underlie the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. This review will summarize the current knowledge of the role of AhR in regulation of intestinal immune homeostasis and inflammation. RECENT FINDINGS: Activation of AhR by dietary ligands is necessary for the maintenance or expansion of innate immune cells in the gut, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and",
    "A Pill for the Ill? Patients\u2019 Reports of Their Experience of the Medical Encounter in the Treatment of Depression\tBackground Starting in the 1960s, a broad-based patients\u2019 rights movement began to question doctors\u2019 paternalism and to demand disclosure of medical information, informed consent, and active participation by the individual in personal health care. According to scholars, these changes contributed to downplay the biomedical approach in favor of a more patient-oriented perspective. The Swedish non-profit organization Consumer Association for Medicines and Health (KILEN) has offered the possibility for consumers to report their perceptions and experiences from their use of medicines in order to strengthen consumer rights within the health care",
    "ASH 50th Anniversary Review: Human natural killer cells\tNatural killer (NK) cells were discovered more than 30 years ago. NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that belong to the innate immune system because unlike T or B lymphocytes of the adaptive or antigen-specific immune system, NK cells do not rearrange T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes from their germline configuration. During the past 2 decades there has been a substantial gain in our understanding of what and how NK-cells \u201csee,\u201d lending important insights into their functions and purpose in normal immune surveillance. The most recent discoveries in NK-cell receptor biology have fueled translational research that has led to remarkable results",
    "Cross-analysis of dietary prescriptions and adherence in 356 hypercholesterolaemic patients.\tBACKGROUND: One of the major issues in controlling serum cholesterol through dietetic intervention appears to be the need to improve patient adherence. AIMS: To explore the many questions regarding barriers to, and motivators for, cholesterol-lowering diet adherence. METHODS: We surveyed French general practitioners' dietetic practices for patients with hypercholesterolaemia, and looked at their patients' attitudes towards such an approach. RESULTS: We analysed 234 doctors' personal questionnaires and 356 patient self-survey questionnaires. Patients' reasons for not complying with the prescribed diet included: 'already having satisfactory food habits' (34.7%), '",
    "The use of placebo interventions in medical practice--a national questionnaire survey of Danish clinicians.\tThe authors sent a questionnaire to 772 randomly selected Danish clinicians and asked them about their use of placebo interventions. Sixty-five percent responded. Among the general practitioners, 86% (95% confidence interval 81-91) reported to have used placebo interventions at least once, and 48% (41-55) to have used placebo interventions more than ten times, within the last year. Hospital-based doctors and private specialists reported to have used placebo interventions less frequently (p < .001). The most important reason for the use of placebo interventions was to avoid",
    "Immunomodulatory effects of a standardized Lycium barbarum fruit juice in Chinese older healthy human subjects.\tLycium barbarum has been traditionally used in combination with several herbs for medicinal properties, but systematic modern clinical evaluation as a single herb has not been reported. To examine the systematic effects of L. barbarum on immune function, general well-being, and safety, we tested the effects of a standardized L. barbarum fruit juice (GoChi, FreeLife International, Phoenix, AZ, USA) at 120 mL/day, equivalent to at least 150 g of fresh fruit, the amount traditionally used, or placebo for 30 days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study",
    "Enhancement of immunity in the elderly by dietary supplementation with the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019.\tBACKGROUND: The aging process can lead to a decline in cellular immunity. Therefore, the elderly could benefit from safe and effective interventions that restore cellular immune functions. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether dietary supplementation with the known immunostimulating probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 could enhance aspects of cellular immunity in elderly subjects. DESIGN: Thirty healthy elderly volunteers (age range: 63-84 y; median: 69 y) participated in a 3-stage dietary supplementation trial lasting 9 wk. During stage 1 (run-in), subjects consumed low-fat milk (200 mL twice daily for 3",

    "Molecular Mechanisms and the Role of Saturated Fatty Acids in the Progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\tThe steady rise in Western obesity rates has been closely linked to significant increases in a multitude of accompanying health problems including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD severity ranges from simple steatosis to acute steatohepatitis, but the molecular mechanisms controlling progression of this disease are poorly understood. Recent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids (FFAs), especially saturated FFAs, may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms, both in experimental models and in NAFLD patients. This review highlights important cellular pathways involved in hepatic lipotoxicity and how the degree of intrahepatic lipid saturation controls",
    "Recent trends and advances in berry health benefits research.\tRecent advances have been made in our scientific understanding of how berries promote human health and prevent chronic illnesses such as some cancers, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cancer is rapidly overtaking heart disease as the number one killer disease in developed countries, and this phenomenon is coupled with a growing aging population and concomitant age-related diseases. Therefore, it is not surprising that consumers are turning toward foods with medicinal properties as promising dietary interventions for disease prevention and health maintenance. Among fruits, berries of all colors have emerged as champions with substantial research data supporting their abilities to positively affect multiple disease states. Apart from"
