    "Whiting refers to a type of fish that belongs to the Gadidae family. These fish are commonly found in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, where they inhabit shallow coastal waters. Whiting have a distinct silver color with a slender body and can grow up to a medium size. They are known for their mild and sweet flavor, making them a popular choice for seafood dishes. Whiting can be cooked in various ways, such as baking, grilling, or frying, and are often served with lemon, herbs, or a light sauce to enhance their delicate taste. Overall, whiting is a versatile and delicious fish that can be enjoyed by seafood lovers around the world.",

    "A higher ratio of beans to white rice is associated with lower cardiometabolic risk factors in Costa Rican adults\tBackground: A high intake of white rice is associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Costa Ricans follow a staple dietary pattern that includes white rice and beans, yet the combined role of these foods on cardiometabolic risk factors has not been studied. Objective: We aimed to determine the association between intake of white rice and beans and the metabolic syndrome and its components in Costa Rican adults (n = 1879) without diabetes. Design: Multivariate-adjusted means were calculated for components of the metabolic syndrome by daily servings of white rice and beans (<1",
    "Associations between elevated homocysteine, cognitive impairment, and reduced white matter volume in healthy old adults.\tOBJECTIVES: Elevated homocysteine has emerged as a risk factor for cognitive impairment even in healthy elderly persons. Reduced brain volume and white matter hyperintensities also occur in healthy elderly as well, but the interrelationships between these have not been well studied. We report these interrelationships in non demented, relatively healthy, community-dwelling older adults from a single East Asian population. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-eight right-handed participants age 55 years and above were evaluated. Persons with medical conditions or neurological diseases other than well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension were excluded. Participants underwent quantitative",
    "White Rice, Brown Rice, and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in US Men and Women\tContext Because of a different degree of processing and nutrient contents, brown rice and white rice may have different effects on risk of type 2 diabetes. Objective To prospectively examine white rice and brown rice consumptions in relation to type 2 diabetes risk in US men and women aged 26\u201387 yr. Design and Setting The Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986\u20132006) and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I (1984\u20132006) and II (1991\u20132005). Participants We prospectively ascertained diet, lifestyle practices, and disease status among 39,765 men and 157,463 women in these cohorts. All participants were free of",
    "Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies of older adults: a shrinking brain.\tAge-related loss of brain tissue has been inferred from cross-sectional neuroimaging studies, but direct measurements of gray and white matter changes from longitudinal studies are lacking. We quantified longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 92 nondemented older adults (age 59-85 years at baseline) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging to determine the rates and regional distribution of gray and white matter tissue loss in older adults. Using images from baseline, 2 year, and 4 year follow-up, we found significant age changes in gray (p < 0.001) and white (p < 0.001",
    "Red Versus White Wine as a Nutritional Aromatase Inhibitor in Premenopausal Women: A Pilot Study\tBackground An increased risk of breast cancer is associated with alcohol consumption; however, it is controversial whether red wine increases this risk. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prevent the conversion of androgens to estrogen and occur naturally in grapes, grape juice, and red, but not white wine. We tested whether red wine is a nutritional AI in premenopausal women. Methods In a cross-over design, 36 women (mean age [SD], 36 [8] years) were assigned to 8 ounces (237\u2009mL) of red wine daily then white wine for 1 month each",
    "Potent antimutagenic activity of white tea in comparison with green tea in the Salmonella assay.\tThere is growing interest in the potential health benefits of tea, including the antimutagenic properties. Four varieties of white tea, which represent the least processed form of tea, were shown to have marked antimutagenic activity in the Salmonella assay, particularly in the presence of S9. The most active of these teas, Exotica China white tea, was significantly more effective than Premium green tea (Dragonwell special grade) against 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and four other heterocyclic amine mutagens, namely 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H",
    "Faecal pH value and its modification by dietary means in South African black and white schoolchildren.\tMean faecal pH values did not differ significantly in groups of rural South African Black schoolchildren of 10--12 years who ate their traditional high-fibre low-fat diet, and urban dwellers who consumed a partially westernized diet. However, both means were significantly lower than those of groups of White schoolchildren. In feeding studies of 5 days' duration, mean faecal pH value of Black children became significantly less acid when white bread replaced maize meal, and became significantly more acid when a supplement of 6 oranges was consumed daily. Supplements which consisted of skim milk, butter, and",
    "Disparities in the prevalence, pathogenesis and progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma between blacks and whites\tThere is marked racial disparity in the incidence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma, with a two to threefold increased risk in blacks compared with whites. The increased risk has been seen both in Africans and African Americans. Similarly, an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies in blacks compared with whites has been noted after adjusting for socioeconomic and other risk factors, suggesting a genetic predisposition. The higher risk of multiple myeloma in blacks is likely a result of the higher prevalence of the premalignant MGUS stage; there are no data to suggest that",
    "Dietary fiber, weight gain, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in young adults.\tCONTEXT: Dietary composition may affect insulin secretion, and high insulin levels, in turn, may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of fiber consumption and its association with insulin levels, weight gain, and other CVD risk factors compared with other major dietary components. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a multicenter population-based cohort study of the change in CVD risk factors over 10 years (1985-1986 to 1995-1996) in Birmingham, Ala; Chicago, III; Minneapolis",

Dietary habits were assessed with validated FFQ at baseline and repeatedly every year during 4 years of follow-up. Using multivariate models to adjust for covariates, long-term weight and waist circumference changes according to quartiles of change in energy-adjusted white and whole-grain bread consumption"
