    "Industrial toxins are environmental pollutants that are released during industrial activities and processes. These toxins can have harmful effects on both human health and the environment. Due to industrialization and the increase in manufacturing processes, the release of industrial toxins has become a significant concern worldwide. Exposure to industrial toxins can lead to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, neurological disorders, and even cancer. In addition, these toxins can contaminate soil, water, and air, affecting ecosystems and wildlife. It is essential for industries to implement proper waste management practices and invest in cleaner technologies to minimize the release of industrial toxins and protect human health and the environment.",
    "Industrial toxins refer to harmful substances produced as byproducts of industrial processes. These toxins can have serious impacts on human health and the environment. They may be released into the air, water, or soil through activities such as manufacturing, mining, and energy production. Exposure to industrial toxins can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, neurological disorders, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, it is crucial for industries to implement proper waste management and pollution control measures to minimize the release of toxins into the environment and protect public health. Governments and regulatory bodies also play a vital role in setting and enforcing standards to ensure that industrial activities are carried out in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Additionally, individuals can take steps to reduce their own exposure to industrial toxins by being informed about potential sources of contamination and making choices that promote a cleaner and healthier environment."

    "industrial toxins, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) causes selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway in humans and other primates. Differences in rates and sites of metabolism of MPTP to its active, toxic, highly polar metabolite, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine), appear to influence species specificity. Pesticides associated to genetically modified foods (PAGMF) are engineered to tolerate herbicides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between maternal and fetal exposure, and to determine exposure levels of GLYP and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphoric acid (AMPA), GLUF and its metabolite 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid (3-MPPA) and Cry1Ab protein (a Bt toxin) in Eastern Townships of Quebec, Canada. The non-protein amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) was first associated with the high incidence of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Parkinsonism Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC) in Guam, and has been implicated as a potential environmental factor in ALS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. BMAA has a number of toxic effects on motor neurons including direct agonist action on NMDA and AMPA receptors, induction. Cyanobacteria produce many neurotoxins including beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) that has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and neurodegenerative disease.

    "MPTP: an industrial chemical and contaminant of illicit narcotics stimulates a new era in research on Parkinson's disease.\tMPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) causes selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway in humans and other primates. It is less specific and much less potent in mice and has only slight effects in rats. Differences in rates and sites of metabolism of MPTP to its active, toxic, highly polar metabolite, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine), appear to influence species specificity. In rats, type B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B), which mediates the conversion of MPTP to MPP+, may act as an enzymatic barrier",
    "Polymyositis after ciguatera toxin exposure.\tBiopsy-proved polymyositis subsequently developed in two patients who were severely poisoned by ciguatera fish toxin. Ciguatera toxin may have several mechanisms of action and may represent more than one toxin. The patients' clinical courses and the unlikelihood of coincidence of contracting both diseases suggested to us a causal relationship. Although we cannot prove this relationship, we suggest a mechanism by which the toxin predisposed the muscle to inflammation.",
    "Ciguatera: recent advances but the risk remains.\tCiguatera is an important form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of seafood. The disease is characterised by gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances. In cases of severe toxicity, paralysis, coma and death may occur. There is no immunity, and the toxins are cumulative. Symptoms may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. The epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resources. Ciguatera is an important medical entity in tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and in the tropical Caribbean. As reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas, it has",
    "Embryotoxic effects of pine needles and pine needle extracts.\tA heat stable toxin present in needles of ponderosa pine was found to be soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform hexanes and 1-butanol. The embryotoxic effects of fresh green pine needles and a chloroform/methanol extract were determined by measuring embryo resorption in pregnant mice. Autoclaving the needles and extract for 1 hour prior to feeding enhanced the embryoresorptive effect by 28% and 32%, respectively. The results of this study revealed that the embryo resorptive dose (ERD50) of heat stable toxin for 1 mouse was 8.95 gms. for fresh green pine needles and 6.46 gms. for autoclaved green pine needles. In addition",
    "PASSCLAIM--gut health and immunity.\tBACKGROUND: The gut and immune system form a complex integrated structure that has evolved to provide effective digestion and defence against ingested toxins and pathogenic bacteria. However, great variation exists in what is considered normal healthy gut and immune function. Thus, whilst it is possible to measure many aspects of digestion and immunity, it is more difficult to interpret the benefits to individuals of variation within what is considered to be a normal range. Nevertheless, it is important to set standards for optimal function for use both by the consumer, industry and those concerned with the public health. The digestive tract is most frequently the object of functional and health",

    "A cluster of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in New Hampshire: a possible role for toxic cyanobacteria blooms.\tCyanobacteria produce many neurotoxins including beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) that has been liked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and neurodegenerative disease. A number of ALS cases have been diagnosed among residents of Enfield, NH, a town encompassing a lake with a history of cyanobacteria algal blooms. To investigate an association between toxic cyanobacterial blooms in New Hampshire and development of ALS, we reviewed records from our institution and other community databases to obtain demographic information on patients diagnosed with ALS within New England. We identified nine ALS patients who lived near Lake Mascoma in Enfield",
    "Domoic acid and human exposure risks: a review.\tDomoic acid is a potent neurotoxin that is naturally produced by several diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. The toxin acts as a glutamate agonist and is excitotoxic in the vertebrate central nervous system and other glutamate receptor-rich organs. Human exposure to domoic acid occurs via the consumption of contaminated shellfish that have accumulated the toxin while filter feeding on toxigenic phytoplankton during blooms. The first reported human domoic acid poisoning event occurred in Canada in 1987 during which clinical signs of acute toxicity such as gastrointestinal distress, confusion, disorientation, memory loss, coma and death were observed. The illness was named amnesic shellfish poisoning (",
    "Presence and Characterization of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli and Other Potentially Diarrheagenic E. coli Strains in Retail Meats\tTo determine the presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other potentially diarrheagenic E. coli strains in retail meats, 7,258 E. coli isolates collected by the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) retail meat program from 2002 to 2007 were screened for Shiga toxin genes. In addition, 1,275 of the E. coli isolates recovered in 2006 were examined for virulence genes specific for other diarrheagenic E. coli strains. Seventeen isolates (16 from ground beef and 1 from a pork chop) were positive for stx genes, including 5 positive for both stx1 and"
