    "Prenatal vitamins are essential supplements designed specifically for pregnant women to help support a healthy pregnancy and promote the well-being of both the mother and developing baby. These vitamins are specially formulated to provide key nutrients such as folic acid, iron, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals that are important for fetal development. Taking prenatal vitamins can help prevent certain birth defects, support the increased nutritional needs during pregnancy, and aid in the overall health of both mother and baby. It is important for pregnant women to discuss with their healthcare provider the appropriate prenatal vitamin regimen to ensure they are getting the necessary nutrients for a healthy pregnancy.",
    "Prenatal vitamins are specially formulated supplements designed to support the nutritional needs of pregnant women and their developing babies. These vitamins provide essential nutrients such as folic acid, iron, calcium, and various vitamins to help ensure proper growth and development during pregnancy. Folic acid, for example, is important for preventing birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. Additionally, iron helps prevent anemia and calcium supports bone health for both the mother and baby. Taking prenatal vitamins as recommended by a healthcare provider can help fill any nutritional gaps and contribute to a healthy pregnancy. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen."

    "prenatal vitamins Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins is associated with increased risk of wheeze and infections in infants. The birth cohort BraMat was established to study whether prenatal exposure to toxicants from the maternal diet affects immunological health outcomes in children. Prenatal and early childhood exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with deficits in cognitive, sensory, motor and other functions measured by neurobehavioral tests. The main objective of this pilot study was to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is effective for visualization of brain function alterations related to neurobehavior in subjects with high prenatal exposure to MeHg and PCBs. Fish consumption provides nutrients, some of which are essential for brain growth and development. All fish contain methyl mercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant. The toxic effect of MeHg seems most damaging during brain development, and thus, prenatal exposure is of greatest concern. We investigate the relation of in utero and child PBDE exposure to neurobehavioral development among participants in CHAMACOS, a California birth cohort. We measured PBDEs in maternal prenatal and child serum samples and examined the association of PBDE concentrations with children\u2019s attention, motor functioning, and cognition at 5 and 7 years.",

    "Decrease in Anogenital Distance among Male Infants with Prenatal Phthalate Exposure\tPrenatal phthalate exposure impairs testicular function and shortens anogenital distance (AGD) in male rodents. We present data from the first study to examine AGD and other genital measurements in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure in humans. A standardized measure of AGD was obtained in 134 boys 2\u201336 months of age. AGD was significantly correlated with penile volume (R = 0.27, p = 0.001) and the proportion of boys with incomplete testicular descent (R = 0.20, p = 0.02). We defined the anogenital index (AGI) as AGD divided by weight at examination [AGI = AGD/weight (mm/kg)",

    "Associations of maternal long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, methyl mercury, and infant development in the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study\tFish consumption during gestation can provide the fetus with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and other nutrients essential for growth and development of the brain. However, fish consumption also exposes the fetus to the neurotoxicant, methyl mercury (MeHg). We studied the association between these fetal exposures and early child development in the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study (SCDNS). Specifically, we examined a priori models of \u03a9-3 and \u03a9-6 LCPUFA measures in maternal serum to test the hypothesis that these LCPUFA families before or after adjusting for prenatal MeHg exposure would reveal associations",

    "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from the maternal diet may be associated with immunosuppressive effects that persist int...\tWe investigated whether prenatal exposure from the maternal diet to the toxicants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins is associated with the development of immune-related diseases in childhood. Children participating in BraMat, a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), were followed in the three first years of life using annual questionnaires (0-3years; n=162, 2-3years; n=180), and blood parameters were examined at three years of age (n=114). The maternal intake of the toxicants was calculated using a validated food frequency",

BIRTH COHORT STUDY IN POLAND\tWe previously reported an association between prenatal exposure to airborne PAH and lower birth weight, birth length and head circumference. The main goal of the present analysis was to assess the possible impact of co-exposure to PAH-containing of barbecued meat consumed during pregnancy on birth outcomes. The birth cohort consisted of 432 pregnant women who gave birth at term (>36 weeks of gestation). Only non-smoking women with singleton pregnancies, 18-35 years of age, and who were free from chronic diseases such as diabetes and",
    "Fish consumption, methylmercury and child neurodevelopment\tPurpose of review To summarize recent evidence regarding associations of early life exposure to mercury from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy, thimerosal in vaccines and dental amalgam with child neurodevelopment. Recent findings Recent publications have built upon previous evidence demonstrating mild detrimental neurocognitive effects from prenatal methylmercury exposure from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy. New studies examining the effects of prenatal fish consumption as well as methylmercury suggest there are benefits from prenatal fish consumption, but also that consumption of fish high in mercury should be avoided. Future studies incorporating information on both the methylmercury and the docosahexaenoic acid contained within fish will help to refine recommendations to optimize outcomes for mothers and children.",
    "Functional MRI approach to developmental methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyl neurotoxicity\tPrenatal and early childhood exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with deficits in cognitive, sensory, motor and other functions measured by neurobehavioral tests. The main objective of this pilot study was to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is effective for visualization of brain function alterations related to neurobehavior in subjects with high prenatal exposure to the two neurotoxicants, MeHg and PCBs. Twelve adolescents (all boys) from a Faroese birth cohort assembled in 1986\u20131987 were recruited based on their prenatal exposures to MeHg and PCB.

    "Nutrient and methyl mercury exposure from consuming fish.\tThere is controversy about the risks and benefits of consuming fish. Fish consumption provides nutrients, some of which are essential for brain growth and development. All fish, however, contain methyl mercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant. The toxic effect of MeHg seems most damaging during brain development, and thus, prenatal exposure is of greatest concern. At present the level of prenatal exposure associated with risk to a child's neurodevelopment is not known. Balancing the rewards and possible risks of fish consumption presents a dilemma to consumers and regulatory authorities. We review the nutrients in fish that are important in brain development and the current",
