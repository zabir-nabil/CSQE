    "Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is a type of cancer that occurs in the mouth or the throat. It can affect various areas, including the lips, tongue, gums, floor of the mouth, and roof of the mouth. Mouth cancer can manifest as sores, lumps, or patches in the mouth that do not heal, pain or difficulty swallowing, persistent sore throat, changes in voice, or numbness in the mouth or lips. Risk factors for developing mouth cancer include tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and a poor diet lacking in fruits and vegetables. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment of mouth cancer, so it is important to seek medical attention if any concerning symptoms arise. Treatment options for mouth cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the stage and location of the cancer. Regular dental check-ups and practicing good oral hygiene can also help in the early detection and prevention of mouth cancer.",
    "Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition that affects the mouth and the surrounding areas. This type of cancer can develop in the lips, tongue, gums, lining of the cheeks, and the roof or floor of the mouth. Symptoms of mouth cancer may include red or white patches in the mouth, a sore that does not heal, persistent pain, difficulty swallowing, and changes in voice.\n\nSeveral risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing mouth cancer, including tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, exposure to the human papillomavirus (HPV), a weakened immune system, and a diet low in fruits and vegetables. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with mouth cancer. Regular dental check-ups, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, maintaining good oral hygiene, and consuming a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer.\n\nIf you notice any unusual symptoms in your mouth or have concerns about mouth cancer, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or dentist for a thorough evaluation and appropriate management. Treatment for mouth cancer may involve a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, depending on the stage and location of the cancer. Seeking prompt medical attention and following the recommended treatment plan can help improve the chances of successful recovery and long-term survival."

    "Effects of vitamins C and E on N-nitroso compound formation, carcinogenesis, and cancer.\tThe properties of N-nitroso compounds (NNC) and of vitamins C and E are briefly described. The author reviews the ability of vitamins C and E to inhibit NNC formation in chemical systems, in nitrite-preserved meat, in experimental animals and in humans. Dietary vitamins C and E both produced 30% to 60% inhibitions in most carcinogenesis experiments employing preformed carcinogens. Vitamin C reversed transformation in an in vitro system. Carcinogenicity tests of the vitamins are reviewed (vitamin C can promote bladder carcinogenesis). Intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (which contain vitamin C",
    "Mortality from malignant diseases-update of the Baltimore union poultry cohort.\tWe previously studied mortality up to 1989 in 2,639 members of a local union who had ever worked in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, because they were exposed to oncogenic viruses present in poultry. In this report, cancer mortality was updated to the year 2003 for 2,580 of the 2,639 subjects who worked exclusively in poultry plants. Mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the US general population through the estimation of proportional mortality and standardized mortality ratios separately for each race/sex group and for the whole cohort. Compared to the US general population, an excess of cancers of the buccal and nasal cavities",
    "Long-term exposure to sodium nitrite and risk of esophageal carcinoma: a cohort study for 30 years.\tThe objective of this study is to investigate the risk of esophageal carcinoma in a cohort with long-term occupational exposure to sodium nitrite. The method used was a retrospective cohort study. A small wood screw manufacturer was founded in 1977 and closed down in 2000. In their production process, the sodium nitrite solution was used to serve as anticorrosive and coolant fluid. One hundred sixty workers in turning and milling shops had direct exposure to sodium nitrite through skin, mouth, and airway because of lack of occupational protective knowledge (study group), whereas 255 workers from",
    "Salivary acetaldehyde increase due to alcohol-containing mouthwash use: a risk factor for oral cancer.\tIncreasing evidence suggests that acetaldehyde, the first and genotoxic metabolite of ethanol, mediates the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages. Ethanol is also contained in a number of ready-to-use mouthwashes typically between 5 and 27% vol. An increased risk of oral cancer has been discussed for users of such mouthwashes; however, epidemiological evidence had remained inconclusive. This study is the first to investigate acetaldehyde levels in saliva after use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes. Ready-to-use mouthwashes and mouthrinses (n = 13) were rinsed in the mouth by healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (",
    "Phase II trial of curcumin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\tPURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer is almost always lethal, and the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for it, gemcitabine and erlotinib, produce objective responses in <10% of patients. We evaluated the clinical biological effects of curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a plant-derived dietary ingredient with potent nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and tumor inhibitory properties, against advanced pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received 8 g curcumin by mouth daily until disease progression, with restaging every 2 months. Serum cytokine levels for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor antagonists and peripheral",
    "Diet, nutrition and the prevention of dental diseases.\tOral health is related to diet in many ways, for example, nutritional influences on craniofacial development, oral cancer and oral infectious diseases. Dental diseases impact considerably on self-esteem and quality of life and are expensive to treat. The objective of this paper is to review the evidence for an association between nutrition, diet and dental diseases and to present dietary recommendations for their prevention. Nutrition affects the teeth during development and malnutrition may exacerbate periodontal and oral infectious diseases. However, the most significant effect of nutrition on teeth is the local action of diet in the mouth on the development of dental caries and enamel erosion",
    "Patients' attitudes to rectal drug administration.\tOne hundred adult patients attending for day case surgery were surveyed by anonymous questionnaire in order to determine their attitudes to rectal drug administration. Fifty four patients did not want an analgesic drug (diclofenac sodium) administered rectally whilst under anaesthesia, all preferring to take it orally if available. Ninety eight patients thought that drugs administered per rectum should always be discussed with them beforehand and a few had very strong feelings about this route of administration. We suggest that prescribers of rectal diclofenac should always discuss it with patients pre-operatively. Whilst many are happy to have suppositories, some young patients are sensitive about this and prefer to take such",
    "Cytotoxicity of Mouthrinses on Epithelial Cells by Micronucleus Test\tObjectives To determine the cytotoxicity of three commercial mouthrinses Klorhex, Andorex and Tanflex on buccal epithelial cells using micronucleus (MN) test. Materials and Methods 28 patients with aged 16\u201324 undergone three mouthrinses\u2019 application were analyzed before and after one week exposure. Physiologic saline was used for the control group. The MN incidence was scored in the buccal epithelial of each participants. The difference in pre- and post-treatment after one week incidence of MN and plaque (PI) and gingival indices (GI) was compared by non-parametric statistical tests. Results The micronuclei incidence increased in Klorhex, Tanflex and Andorex groups after exposure to",
    "Aromatherapy with peppermint, isopropyl alcohol, or placebo is equally effective in relieving postoperative nausea.\tTo determine whether aromatherapy can reduce postoperative nausea, the investigators studied 33 ambulatory surgery patients who complained of nausea in the PACU. After indicating the severity of nausea on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), subjects received randomized aromatherapy with isopropyl alcohol, oil of peppermint, or saline (placebo). The vapors were inhaled deeply through the nose from scented gauze pads held directly beneath the patients' nostrils and exhaled slowly through the mouth. Two and 5 minutes later, the subjects rated their nausea on the VAS. Overall nausea scores decreased from 60.6 +/- 4.3",
    "Monitoring of buccal epithelial cells by alkaline comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis technique) in cytogenetic evaluation of chlorhexidine.\tDuring the last few years, there has been increasing interest in buccal epithelial cells for cytogenetic evaluation of different materials. In the present study, the use of these cells and peripheral lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) with comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis, or SCGE) is reported. This technique detects DNA strand breaks in individual cells in alkaline conditions. Thirteen volunteers were requested to rinse their mouths with 0.12% CHX solution for 18 days. Buccal epithelial cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from all participants at baseline and the"
