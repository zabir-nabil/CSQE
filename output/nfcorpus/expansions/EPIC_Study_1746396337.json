    "The EPIC Study, short for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, is a large multinational research study aimed at examining the relationship between diet, lifestyle, environmental factors, and various types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Launched in the 1990s, the EPIC Study involves hundreds of thousands of participants from different European countries, providing valuable insights into the factors that may influence the development of chronic conditions. The study's findings have been instrumental in shaping public health policies and recommendations related to diet and lifestyle choices. Through its extensive data collection and analysis, the EPIC Study continues to be a vital resource for researchers and policymakers seeking to understand and address the complex interactions between health outcomes and various lifestyle factors.",
    "The EPIC study, short for the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, is a large prospective cohort study that aims to investigate the relationships between diet, lifestyle, environmental factors, and the occurrence of cancer and other chronic diseases. Launched in the 1990s, the EPIC study involves over half a million participants from 10 European countries. The study collects a wide range of data, including dietary habits, physical activity levels, anthropometric measurements, and biomarkers. By following participants over an extended period, the EPIC study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between lifestyle factors and disease risk. The findings from the EPIC study have contributed significantly to our understanding of how diet and other lifestyle factors can impact health outcomes, leading to important public health recommendations and initiatives."

    "Association between dietary meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes: the EPIC-InterAct study.\tAIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A diet rich in meat has been reported to contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. The present study aims to investigate the association between meat consumption and incident type 2 diabetes in the EPIC-InterAct study, a large prospective case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. METHODS: During 11.7 years of follow-up, 12,403 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified among 340,234 adults from eight European countries. A centre-stratified random subsample of 16,835 individuals was selected in order to perform a",
    "Occupation and risk of lymphoma: a multicentre prospective cohort study (EPIC).\tOBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that certain occupations and related exposures may increase the risk of malignant lymphoma. Farming, printing and paper industry, wood processing, meat handling and processing, welding, shoe and leather manufacturing and teaching profession are among the categories that have been implicated in previous studies. The relationship between occupation and malignant lymphoma has been investigated in a large European prospective study. METHODS: We investigated occupational risks for lymphomas in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). The mean follow-up time for 348,555 subjects was 9 years (SD: 2 years). The",

    "Phytoestrogen consumption and association with breast, prostate and colorectal cancer in EPIC Norfolk.\tPhytoestrogens are polyphenolic secondary plant metabolites that have structural and functional similarities to 17beta-oestradiol and have been associated with a protective effect against hormone-related cancers. Most foods in the UK only contain small amounts of phytoestrogens (median content 21 microg/100 g) and the highest content is found in soya and soya-containing foods. The highest phytoestrogen content in commonly consumed foods is found in breads (average content 450 microg/100 g), the main source of isoflavones in the UK diet. The phytoestrogen consumption in cases and controls was considerably lower than in Asian countries. No significant associations between phytoestrogen",
