    "Lard is a type of fat that is extracted from the fat tissue of pigs. It is commonly used in cooking and baking to add flavor and moisture to dishes. Lard has a high smoke point, which makes it ideal for frying and saut\u00e9ing. It can also be used as a substitute for butter or vegetable oil in many recipes. While lard was once vilified for its high saturated fat content, it has seen a resurgence in popularity among chefs and home cooks due to its unique flavor profile and versatility in the kitchen.",
