    "Recent studies have suggested that antioxidant-rich spices may play a role in counteracting the effects of a high-fat meal. Antioxidants are known for their ability to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, which are produced in excess when consuming a high-fat diet. Spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and ginger are abundant in antioxidants and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and protective properties. When incorporated into a high-fat meal, these spices may help mitigate some of the negative impacts of the fats on the body. However, it is vital to remember that consuming a high-fat diet regularly can still pose risks to health, and adding antioxidants through spices should not be seen as a complete solution. A balanced diet rich in nutrients is essential for overall health and well-being.",
    "Recent studies suggest that antioxidant-rich spices may indeed have a positive impact on counteracting the effects of a high-fat meal. High-fat meals are known to contribute to oxidative stress in the body, leading to inflammation and potential health issues. However, spices like turmeric, cinnamon, and cloves are packed with antioxidants that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to combat oxidative stress. When added to a high-fat meal, these spices may help to reduce the negative impact on the body by neutralizing free radicals and promoting overall health. While more research is needed to fully understand the extent of this effect, incorporating antioxidant-rich spices into high-fat meals may be a beneficial strategy for mitigating some of the potential harm caused by excessive fat consumption."

    "Can antioxidant-rich spices counteract the effects of a high-fat meal? The objective of this study was to examine whether adding 14 g of a high antioxidant spice blend to a 5060-kJ (1200 kcal) meal exerted significant postprandial effects on markers of plasma antioxidant status and metabolism. Culinary spices have demonstrated potent in vitro antioxidant properties. The objective was to compare the short-term effect of a high-fat meal and a high-carbohydrate meal, with and without dietary antioxidants, on vasomotor, antiplatelet, and hemostatic functions of the endothelium in healthy subjects. It has been hypothesized that plant antioxidants may contribute to the beneficial health effects of dietary plants. Our objective was to develop a comprehensive food database consisting of the total antioxidant content of typical foods as well as other dietary items such as traditional medicine plants, herbs and spices and dietary supplements.",

    "A High Antioxidant Spice Blend Attenuates Postprandial Insulin and Triglyceride Responses and Increases Some Plasma Measures of Antioxidant Activity in Healthy, Overweight Men\tThere is much interest in the potential of dietary antioxidants to attenuate in vivo oxidative stress, but little characterization of the time course of plasma effects exists. Culinary spices have demonstrated potent in vitro antioxidant properties. The objective of this study was to examine whether adding 14 g of a high antioxidant spice blend to a 5060-kJ (1200 kcal) meal exerted significant postprandial effects on markers of plasma antioxidant status and metabolism. Healthy overweight men (n = 6) consumed a control and spiced meal in a randomized crossover design with 1 wk between",
    "Effect of dietary antioxidants on postprandial endothelial dysfunction induced by a high-fat meal in healthy subjects.\tBACKGROUND: Persons following current dietary guidelines have a lower risk of mortality from coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the short-term effect of a high-fat meal and a high-carbohydrate meal, with and without dietary antioxidants, on vasomotor, antiplatelet, and hemostatic functions of the endothelium in healthy subjects. DESIGN: In an observer-blinded, randomized crossover study, 25 (13 men and 12 women) healthy subjects were given each of 3 meals in random order at 1-wk intervals: a high-fat meal (760",
    "The Okinawan diet: health implications of a low-calorie, nutrient-dense, antioxidant-rich dietary pattern low in glycemic load.\tResidents of Okinawa, the southernmost prefecture of Japan, are known for their long average life expectancy, high numbers of centenarians, and accompanying low risk of age-associated diseases. Much of the longevity advantage in Okinawa is thought to be related to a healthy lifestyle, particularly the traditional diet, which is low in calories yet nutritionally dense, especially with regard to phytonutrients in the form of antioxidants and flavonoids. Research suggests that diets associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases are similar to the traditional Okinawan diet, that is,",
    "Postprandial metabolic events and fruit-derived phenolics: a review of the science.\tThere is increasing evidence that the postprandial state is an important contributing factor to chronic disease. The role of fruit phenolic compounds to protect health and lower disease risk through their actions in mitigating fed-state metabolic and oxidative stressors is of interest and the topic of the present paper. Two main questions are posed: first, what is the role of plant foods, specifically fruits rich in complex and simple phenolic compounds in postprandial metabolic management; and second, does the evidence support consuming these fruits with meals as a practical strategy to preserve health and lower risk for disease? This review provides an",
    "The postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function.\tOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function, which may be an atherogenic factor. BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, pasta, fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine, is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that a Mediterranean diet, which substituted omega-3-fatty-acid-enriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega-9 fatty-acid-rich olive oil, reduced cardiovascular events. METHODS: We fed 10 healthy, normolipidemic subjects five meals containing 900 kcal and 50 g fat",

    "Impaired endothelial function following a meal rich in used cooking fat.\tOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that intake of used cooking fat is associated with impaired endothelial function. BACKGROUND: Diets containing high levels of lipid oxidation products may accelerate atherogenesis, but the effect on endothelial function is unknown. METHODS: Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation and glyceryl trinitrate-induced endothelium-independent dilation of the brachial artery were investigated in 10 men. Subjects had arterial studies before and 4 h after three test meals: 1) a meal (fat 64.4 g) rich in cooking fat that had been used for deep frying in a fast food restaurant;",
    "Effect of a single high-fat meal on endothelial function in healthy subjects.\tAlthough there is a well-established relation between serum cholesterol and coronary artery disease risk, individual and national variations in this association suggest that other factors are involved in atherogenesis. High-fat diet associated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins have also been suggested to be atherogenic. To assess the direct effect of postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins on endothelial function, an early factor in atherogenesis--10 healthy, normocholesterolemic volunteers--were studied before and for 6 hours after single isocaloric high- and low-fat meals (900 calorie; 50 and 0 g fat, respectively). Endothelial function, in the form of flow",
    "Could a vegetarian diet reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress? A review of the literature.\tOxidative stress is a natural physiological process that describes an imbalance between free radical production and the ability of the antioxidant defence system of the body to neutralize free radicals. Free radicals can be beneficial as they may promote wound healing and contribute to a healthy immune response. However, free radicals can have a detrimental impact when they interfere with the regulation of apoptosis and thus play a role in the promotion of some cancers and conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Antioxidants are molecules that reduce the damage associated with oxidative stress by counteracting free radicals. Regular exercise is a vital component of a healthy"
