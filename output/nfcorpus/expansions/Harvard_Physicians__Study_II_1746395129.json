    "The Harvard Physicians' Study II was a groundbreaking research initiative that aimed to investigate the effects of lifestyle factors on health outcomes among a cohort of male physicians. Building on the findings of the original Harvard Physicians' Study, which focused on cardiovascular disease, this follow-up study delved deeper into understanding the role of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle choices in influencing overall health and longevity.\n\nOver the course of several decades, researchers collected and analyzed data on a range of variables, including smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, and dietary patterns. The study yielded numerous important insights into the factors that contribute to disease development and mortality in this population.\n\nAmong the key findings of the Harvard Physicians' Study II were the significant impacts of smoking, diet quality, and regular physical activity on reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The research also highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress levels for long-term health and well-being.\n\nOverall, the Harvard Physicians' Study II provided valuable evidence supporting the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle for preventing disease and promoting longevity. The insights gained from this research continue to inform public health policies and individual choices to this day.",
    "The Harvard Physicians' Study II was a long-term research project conducted by Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health to investigate the effects of various lifestyle factors on health outcomes in a population of male physicians. This study sought to gather data on diet, exercise, tobacco use, and other lifestyle habits to determine their impact on chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. By following a large cohort of physicians over many years, researchers were able to draw important conclusions about the relationship between lifestyle choices and health outcomes. The findings of the Harvard Physicians' Study II have provided valuable insights that have helped to shape public health recommendations and guidelines for disease prevention and management."

    "Vitamins E and C in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Men: The Physicians\u2019 Health Study II Randomized Trial\tContext Basic and observational studies suggest vitamins E or C may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, few long-term trials have evaluated men at initially low risk of CVD, and no previous trial in men has examined vitamin C alone in the prevention of CVD. Objective To test whether long-term vitamin E or C supplementation decreases risk of major cardiovascular events among men.

Observational studies examining regular multivitamin use have been inconsistently associated with CVD, with no long-term clinical trials of multivitamin use. Objective To determine whether long-term multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of major cardiovascular events among men. Design The Physicians' Health Study II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a common daily multivitamin, that began in 1997 with continued treatment and follow-up through June 1,",
    "Long-term morbidity and mortality of overweight adolescents. A follow-up of the Harvard Growth Study of 1922 to 1935.\tBACKGROUND: Overweight in adults is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In contrast, the long-term effect of overweight in adolescence on morbidity and mortality is not known. METHODS: We studied the relation between overweight and morbidity and mortality in 508 lean or overweight adolescents 13 to 18 years old who participated in the Harvard Growth Study of 1922 to 1935. Overweight adolescents were defined as those with a body-mass index that on two occasions was greater than the 75th percentile in subjects of the same age and sex in a large national survey",
    "High school dietary dairy intake and teenage acne.\tBACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest possible associations between Western diet and acne. We examined data from the Nurses Health Study II to retrospectively evaluate whether intakes of dairy foods during high school were associated with physician-diagnosed severe teenage acne. METHODS: We studied 47,355 women who completed questionnaires on high school diet in 1998 and physician-diagnosed severe teenage acne in 1989. We estimated the prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals of acne history across categories of intakes. RESULTS: After accounting for age, age at menarche, body mass index, and energy intake, the multivariate prevalence ratio (95% confidence intervals; P value for",
    "Caffeine and risk of Parkinson disease in a large cohort of men and women\tBackground Caffeine consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson disease. The association is strong and consistent in men, but uncertain in women, possibly because of an interaction with hormone replacement therapy. We sought to confirm these findings using data on Parkinson disease incidence in the CPS II Nutrition Cohort, a large prospective study of men and women. Methods We conducted a prospective study of caffeine intake and risk of PD within the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. Intakes of coffee and other sources of caffeine were assessed at baseline. Incident cases of PD (n = 317; 197 men and",

    "Higher Diet Quality Is Associated with Decreased Risk of All-Cause, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer Mortality among Older Adults\tIncreased attention in dietary research and guidance has been focused on dietary patterns, rather than on single nutrients or food groups, because dietary components are consumed in combination and correlated with one another. However, the collective body of research on the topic has been hampered by the lack of consistency in methods used. We examined the relationships between 4 indices\u2014the Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (HEI-2010), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)\u2014and all-cause, cardiovascular disease"
