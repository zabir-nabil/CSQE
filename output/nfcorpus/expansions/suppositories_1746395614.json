    "Suppositories are a type of medication delivery method that involves inserting a solid, bullet-shaped dosage form into the rectum or vagina. This form of medication allows for the drug to be absorbed directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system and resulting in quicker absorption and delivery of the medication. Suppositories are often used when a patient is unable to take medication orally, such as in cases of nausea or vomiting, or when a healthcare provider wants to ensure a more targeted delivery of the medication. It is important to always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or on the medication packaging when using suppositories to ensure safe and effective administration.",
    "Suppositories are a form of medication that is designed to be inserted into the rectum or vagina. They are often tapered at one end for easier insertion and typically melt at body temperature. Suppositories are used for various reasons, such as to deliver medications that may cause stomach upset if taken orally, to treat conditions like constipation or hemorrhoids locally, or to provide rapid and efficient absorption of medication directly into the bloodstream. When using suppositories, it is important to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional to ensure safe and effective use."

    "Examination of the effectiveness of peppermint aromatherapy on nausea in women post C-section.\tPURPOSE: This study examined the effect of peppermint spirits on postoperative nausea in women following a scheduled C-section. DESIGN: A pretest-posttest research design with three groups was used. The peppermint group inhaled peppermint spirits, the placebo aromatherapy control group inhaled an inert placebo, green-colored sterile water, and the standard antiemetic therapy control group received standard antiemetics, usually intravenous ondansetron or promethazine suppositories. METHODS: Women were randomly assigned to a group on admission to the hospital. If they became nauseated, nurses on the mother-baby unit assessed their nausea (baseline),"
