It is used in alloys to improve their mechanical properties, in the production of fireworks for its bright white light emission, and in healthcare as a component of antacids and laxatives. Overall, magnesium is a versatile element with both health benefits and practical uses in various industries.",
    "Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid that is essential for many biological functions in both plants and animals. Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body and is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, playing a key role in various physiological processes such as energy production, muscle function, and nerve transmission. Common food sources of magnesium include nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables. Deficiency in magnesium can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramps, fatigue, and abnormal heart rhythms. It is important to maintain adequate levels of magnesium through a balanced diet or supplementation to support overall health and well-being."

    "magnesium The aim of this study was to assess the association between magnesium intake and CVD and mortality risk in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk with high average magnesium intake. After the diet shift, intakes of zinc and magnesium did not change but that of selenium decreased by 40%. Three months after the diet shift, plasma and hair concentrations of zinc, copper, and selenium had decreased but those of magnesium had increased. The calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc and copper contents were determined for both dried herb samples and prepared infusions, and the extraction rates were calculated. The contents of individual elements in herbs and infusions depended on the type of raw material, as well as on its origin. The uninfarcted heart muscle contained significantly lower concentrations of magnesium, iron, and potassium and a significantly higher concentration of calcium than the heart muscle from a group of normal controls. A vegetarian diet generally includes plenty of vegetables and fruits, which are rich in phytochemicals, antioxidants, fiber, magnesium, vitamins C and E, Fe\u00b3\u207a, folic acid and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and is low in cholesterol, total fat and saturated fatty acid, sodium, Fe\u00b2\u207a, zinc, vitamin A, B\u2081\u2082 and D, and especially n-3 PUFA.

    "Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with mortality in adults at high cardiovascular disease risk.\tThe relation between dietary magnesium intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or mortality was evaluated in several prospective studies, but few of them have assessed the risk of all-cause mortality, which has never been evaluated in Mediterranean adults at high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to assess the association between magnesium intake and CVD and mortality risk in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk with high average magnesium intake. The present study included 7216 men and women aged 55-80 y from the PREDIMED (Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea) study, a randomized clinical trial. Participants were",
    "Trace element status in healthy subjects switching from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet for 12 mo.\tThe consequences of a change from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet for 12 mo on trace element concentrations in plasma, hair, urine, and feces were studied in 16 women and 4 men. After the diet shift, intakes of zinc and magnesium did not change but that of selenium decreased by 40%. Three months after the diet shift, plasma and hair concentrations of zinc, copper, and selenium had decreased but those of magnesium had increased and the concentrations of mercury, lead, and cadmium in hair were lower. Also, the excretion of zinc, copper,",
    "Herbal infusions as a source of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc and copper in human nutrition.\tThe study material consisted of five herbs: chamomile (flowers), mint (leaves), St John's wort (flowers and leaves), sage (leaves) and nettle (leaves), sourced from three producers. The calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc and copper contents were determined for both dried herb samples and prepared infusions, and the extraction rates were calculated. Mineral components were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Analysis showed that the contents of individual elements in herbs and infusions depended on the type of raw material, as well as on its origin.",
    "Differences in metal content of the heart muscle in death from ischemic heart disease.\tIn a group of patients dying suddenly from ischemic heart disease, the uninfarcted heart muscle contained significantly lower concentrations of magnesium, iron, and potassium and a significantly higher concentration of calcium than the heart muscle from a group of normal controls and a group of patients dying more than three months after a coronary thrombosis. The late death group had significantly lower concentrations of manganese and copper than the normal group, and a slight decrease in magnesium concentration which was probably significant. There was no significant difference in the sodium concentration between the three groups. The results are discussed in relation to the increased death",
    "Nutrient intake in the GEICO multicenter trial: the effects of a multicomponent worksite intervention\tBackground/objectives: To assess the effects on macro- and micronutrient intake of a nutrition intervention program in corporate settings across the United States. Subjects/methods: Two hundred and ninety-two individuals who were overweight or had type 2 diabetes were recruited from 10 sites of a US insurance company. Two hundred and seventy-one participants completed baseline diet recalls, and 183 participants completed dietary recalls at 18 weeks.

    "A vegetarian dietary pattern as a nutrient-dense approach to weight management: an analysis of the national health and nutrition examination survey...\tBACKGROUND: Population-based studies have shown that vegetarians have lower body mass index than nonvegetarians, suggesting that vegetarian diet plans may be an approach for weight management. However, a perception exists that vegetarian diets are deficient in certain nutrients. OBJECTIVE: To compare dietary quality of vegetarians, nonvegetarians, and dieters, and to test the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet would not compromise nutrient intake when used to manage body weight. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004) dietary and anthropometric data",
    "Increased prevalence of constipation in pre-school children is attributable to under-consumption of plant foods: A community-based study.\tAIM: To evaluate consumption of foods rich in dietary fibre and its relation to the prevalence of constipation in pre-school children. METHODS: In total, 368 children aged 3-5 years were randomly selected from kindergartens in Hong Kong. Constipation was confirmed by Rome-criteria. Children with normal bowel habits served as non-constipated controls. Consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole-grain cereals and fluid were determined using a 3-day food record. RESULTS: A total of 28.8% children were reported to have constipation.",

    "Nuts, hypertension and endothelial function.\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS: High blood pressure (BP) is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Among lifestyle factors, diet plays a key role in the prevention and control of high BP. Therefore, it is important to elucidate which dietary components can exert beneficial effects on BP through modulation of endothelial function (EF) or by other mechanisms. In this paper we review the role of nutrients, foods, particularly nuts, and dietary patterns on BP control. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because nuts are low in sodium and contain significant amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, minerals such as magnesium, potassium and calcium,",
    "Bronchial reactivity and dietary antioxidants\tBACKGROUND: It has been postulated that dietary antioxidants may influence the expression of allergic diseases and asthma. To test this hypothesis a case-control study was performed, nested in a cross sectional study of a random sample of adults, to investigate the relationship between allergic disease and dietary antioxidants. METHODS: The study was performed in rural general practices in Grampian, Scotland. A validated dietary questionnaire was used to measure food intake of cases, defined, firstly, as people with seasonal allergic-type symptoms and, secondly, those with bronchial hyperreactivity confirmed by methacholine challenge, and of controls without allergic symptoms or bronchial reactivity.
