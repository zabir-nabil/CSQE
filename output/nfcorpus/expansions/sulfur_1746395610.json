    "Sulfur is a chemical element with the symbol \"S\" and atomic number 16. It is a non-metal that can be found in various forms such as sulfuric acid, sulfides, and elemental sulfur. Sulfur plays a crucial role in various industries including the production of fertilizers, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. It is also an essential nutrient for plants and animals, participating in many biological processes. Sulfur has a distinct smell often described as \"rotten eggs\" and is known for its yellow color. Additionally, sulfur has numerous industrial applications, from being used in vulcanizing rubber to producing sulfuric acid for batteries and industrial processes.",
    "Sulfur is a non-metal element with the chemical symbol S and atomic number 16. It is widely found in nature and has several important uses. Sulfur is a key component in amino acids, which are essential for building proteins in living organisms. It is also used in various industrial processes, such as in the production of fertilizers, chemicals, and rubber. Sulfur compounds can be found in many minerals, ores, and even in some meteorites.

    "sulfur, There is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue. The aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferation. Dietary sulfur-containing amino acids have been reported to improve the mineral status of experimental animals. Our objective was to examine whether sulfur compound-rich Allium spices have a similar potential of beneficially modulating the mineral bioavailability. Endogenous sulfite is generated as a consequence of the body's normal processing of sulfur-containing amino acids. Sulfites occur as a consequence of fermentation and also occur naturally in a number of foods and beverages. Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite).",

    "Generation of gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue and suppression of gas diffusion as an antitumour treatment.\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mechanisms of cancer cell growth and metastasis are still not entirely understood, especially from the viewpoint of chemical reactions in tumours. Glycolytic metabolism is markedly accelerated in cancer cells, causing the accumulation of glucose (a reducing sugar) and methionine (an amino acid), which can non-enzymatically react and form carcinogenic substances. There is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue. The aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferation. METHODS: Products formed",
    "Higher bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grains in the presence of garlic and onion.\tBioavailability of micronutrients iron and zinc is particularly low from plant foods. Hence there is a need to evolve a food-based strategy to improve the same to combat widespread deficiencies of these minerals in a population dependent on plant foods. Dietary sulfur-containing amino acids have been reported to improve the mineral status of experimental animals. Our objective was to examine whether sulfur compound-rich Allium spices have a similar potential of beneficially modulating the mineral bioavailability. In this context, we examined the influence of exogenously added garlic and onion on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grains.",
    "Sulfite sensitivity: significance in human health.\tEndogenous sulfite is generated as a consequence of the body's normal processing of sulfur-containing amino acids. Sulfites occur as a consequence of fermentation and also occur naturally in a number of foods and beverages. As food additives, sulfiting agents were first used in 1664 and approved in the United States as long ago as the 1800s. With such long experience with their use, it is easy to understand why these substances have been regarded as safe. They are currently used for a variety of preservative properties, including controlling microbial growth, preventing browning and spoilage, and bleaching some foods. It is estimated that up to 500,000 (",
    "Contribution of dietary protein to sulfide production in the large intestine: an in vitro and a controlled feeding study in humans.\tBACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a luminally acting, bacterially derived cell poison that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis. Sulfide generation in the colon is probably driven by dietary components such as sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) and inorganic sulfur (eg, sulfite). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the contribution of SAAs from meat to sulfide production by intestinal bacteria with use of both a model culture system in vitro and an in vivo human feeding study. DESIGN: Five healthy men were housed in a metabolic suite and fed a sequence of 5 diets for",
    "Investigating Antibacterial Effects of Garlic (Allium sativum) Concentrate and Garlic-Derived Organosulfur Compounds on Campylobacter jejuni by Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, and Electron Microscopy\tFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the cell injury and inactivation of Campylobacter jejuni from exposure to antioxidants from garlic. C. jejuni was treated with various concentrations of garlic concentrate and garlic-derived organosulfur compounds in growth media and saline at 4, 22, and 35\u00b0C. The antimicrobial activities of the diallyl sulfides increased with the number of sulfur atoms (diallyl sulfide < diallyl disulfide < diallyl trisulfide). FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that organosulfur compounds",
    "Antimicrobial properties of Allium sativum (garlic).\tAlthough garlic has been used for its medicinal properties for thousands of years, investigations into its mode of action are relatively recent. Garlic has a wide spectrum of actions; not only is it antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal, but it also has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and immune systems. Resurgence in the use of natural herbal alternatives has brought the use of medicinal plants to the forefront of pharmacological investigations, and many new drugs are being discovered. This review aims to address the historical use of garlic and its sulfur chemistry, and to provide a basis for further research into its antimicrobial properties.",
    "Dietary protein and bone health: harmonizing conflicting theories.\tA precise understanding of the role of dietary protein in bone health has been evasive despite decades of research. It is known that a dietary acid load is harmful to bone, and sulfur-containing amino acids are metabolized to provide such an acid load. It is also known that protein elevates urine calcium loss. However, recent clinical studies and a meta-analysis have indicated either no effect or a modest benefit associated with higher protein intakes. These contradictory considerations may be explained by the existence of a two-faced relationship between protein and bone, with simultaneous positive and negative pathways. In opposition to the negative effects",
    "Vegetarian diets and public health: biomarker and redox connections.\tVegetarian diets are rich in antioxidant phytochemicals. However, they may not act as antioxidants in vivo, and yet still have important signaling and regulatory functions. Some may act as pro-oxidants, modulating cellular redox tone and oxidizing redox sensitive sites. In this review, evidence for health benefits of vegetarian diets is presented from different perspectives: epidemiological, biomarker, evolutionary, and public health, as well as antioxidant. From the perspective of molecular connections between diet and health, evidence of a role for plasma ascorbic acid as a biomarker for future disease risk is presented. Basic concepts of redox-based cell signaling",

    "Nutrition and colonic health: the critical role of the microbiota.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight mechanisms whereby diet affects colonic function and disease patterns. RECENT FINDINGS: Topical nutrients are preferentially used by the gut mucosa to maintain structure and function. With the colon, topical nutrients are generated by the colonic microbiota to maintain mucosal health. Most importantly, short chain fatty acids control proliferation and differentiation, thereby reducing colon cancer risk. In patients with massive loss of small intestine, short chain fatty acid production supports survival by releasing up to 1000 kcal energy/day. Human studies show that the microbiota synthesizes a large pool of utilizable folate which may support survival in impoverished populations"
