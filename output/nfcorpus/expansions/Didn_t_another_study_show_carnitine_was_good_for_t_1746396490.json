    "Yes, another study did indeed show that carnitine can be beneficial for heart health. Carnitine is a natural compound that plays a crucial role in energy production and metabolism within the body, particularly in the heart and muscles. Research has indicated that carnitine supplementation may help improve symptoms of heart failure, reduce angina symptoms, and potentially lower the risk of certain heart conditions. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of carnitine in promoting heart health can vary depending on individual factors such as overall health status, dosage, and specific health conditions. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have existing heart conditions or concerns.",
    "Yes, there have been studies that suggest that carnitine may be beneficial for heart health. Carnitine is a natural compound that plays a crucial role in the body's energy production, particularly in the transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria where they can be used as a source of energy. Some research has shown that carnitine supplementation may help improve heart function, increase exercise capacity, and reduce symptoms in individuals with certain heart conditions. However, it is important to note that there is still ongoing research in this area, and it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements."

    "Intestinal microbiota metabolism of L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis\tIntestinal microbiota metabolism of choline/phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota metabolism of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis. Omnivorous subjects are shown to produce significantly more TMAO than vegans/vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. Specific bacterial taxa in human feces are shown to associate with both plasma TMAO and dietary status. Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac",
    "Clinical herd health, farm management and antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter coli on finishing pig farms in Switzerland.\tThe world-wide increase of antimicrobial resistance in micro-organisms complicates medical treatment of infected humans. We did a risk-factor analysis for the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter coli on 64 Swiss pig finishing farms. Between May and November 2001, 20 faecal samples per farm were collected from the floor of pens holding finishing pigs shortly before slaughter. Samples were pooled and cultured for Campylobacter species. Isolated Campylobacter strains were tested for resistance against selected antimicrobials. Additionally, information on herd health and management aspects was available from another study. Because data quality on the history of",
    "Vegetarian diet affects genes of oxidative metabolism and collagen synthesis.\tBACKGROUND/AIM: A vegetarian diet is known to prevent a series of diseases but may influence the balance of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as well as collagen synthesis. This study compares expression patterns of relevant genes in oral mucosa of omnivores and vegetarians. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was applied for analysis of mRNA levels from carnitine transporter OCTN2, hepatic CPT1A and nonhepatic CPT1B isoforms of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and collagen (CCOL2A1) in oral mucosa. RESULTS: Compared with volunteers with traditional eating habits, carbohydrate consumption was significantly higher (+22%) in vegetarians. This was associated with a significant stimulation of CPT1A",
    "Mediterranean diet and public health: personal reflections.\tMy concern about diet as a public health problem began in the early 1950s in Naples, where we observed very low incidences of coronary heart disease associated with what we later came to call the \"good Mediterranean diet.\" The heart of this diet is mainly vegetarian, and differs from American and northern European diets in that it is much lower in meat and dairy products and uses fruit for dessert. These observations led to our subsequent research in the Seven Countries Study, in which we demonstrated that saturated fat is the major dietary villain. Today, the healthy Mediterranean diet is changing and coronary heart disease is no longer confined",
    "Dexamethasone facilitates lipid accumulation in chicken skeletal muscle.\tThe effects of glucocorticoid on lipid metabolism of broiler chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) skeletal muscle were investigated. Male Arbor Acres chickens (35 days old) were subjected to dexamethasone treatment for 3 days. We found that dexamethasone retards body growth while facilitating lipid accumulation. In M. pectoralis major (PM), dexamethasone increased the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) mRNA and decreased the expression of liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (L-CPT1), adenosine-",

PURPOSE: To summarize evidence about putative risk and protective factors for cognitive decline in older adults and the effects of interventions for preserving cognition. DATA SOURCES: English-language publications in MEDLINE, HuGEpedia, AlzGene, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1984 through 27 October 2009.

Comparison of flavan-3-ol content with nonfat co...\tA survey of a broad range of chocolate- and cocoa-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers, which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidins. Samples consisted of the three or four top-selling products within the following six categories: natural cocoa powder, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized for percent fat (% fat),",
