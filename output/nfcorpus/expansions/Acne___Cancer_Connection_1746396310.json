    "Recent scientific studies have explored the potential connection between acne and cancer. While acne is a common skin condition caused by inflammation and excess oil production in the skin's pores, cancer is a serious disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Despite their differences, some research suggests that there may be a link between the two conditions. One possible explanation is that chronic inflammation associated with severe acne could potentially increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Additionally, some acne medications, such as retinoids, have been studied for their potential anti-cancer properties. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between acne and cancer and to explore any potential implications for prevention and treatment strategies. It is important for individuals with acne to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice and care.",
    "Research has shown that there may be a potential link between acne and cancer, although the connection is not entirely clear. Some studies suggest that individuals with a history of severe acne may have a slightly increased risk of certain types of cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand this relationship and determine any potential underlying factors. It is important for those with acne to continue practicing good skincare habits and to consult with healthcare professionals for appropriate guidance and monitoring. It is also essential to remember that acne itself is a common skin condition and is not directly linked to causing cancer."

    "ACNE AND RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER\tIn a recent study, prostatectomy specimens from which Propionibacterium acnes was cultured were more likely to have inflammation than culture-negative specimens or specimens positive for other bacteria, leading the authors to hypothesize that P. acnes-mediated inflammation may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis. To indirectly explore associations between P. acnes and prostate cancer, we investigated severe acne, as measured by tetracycline use for four or more years, in relation to incident prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. On the 1992 follow-up questionnaire, participants were asked whether they had ever used \u201ctetracycline for at least two months at a time (e.g., for acne",
    "Diet in acne: further evidence for the role of nutrient signalling in acne pathogenesis.\tRecent evidence underlines the role of Western diet in the pathogenesis of acne. Acne is absent in populations consuming Palaeolithic diets with low glycaemic load and no consumption of milk or dairy products. Two randomized controlled studies, one of which is presented in this issue of Acta Dermato-Venereologica, have provided evidence for the beneficial therapeutic effects of low glycaemic load diets in acne. Epidemiological evidence confirms that milk consumption has an acne-promoting or acne-aggravating effect. Recent progress in understanding the nutrient-sensitive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) allows a new view of nutrient",
    "Evidence for acne-promoting effects of milk and other insulinotropic dairy products.\tAcne vulgaris, the most common skin disease of western civilization, has evolved to an epidemic affecting more than 85% of adolescents. Acne can be regarded as an indicator disease of exaggerated insulinotropic western nutrition. Especially milk and whey protein-based products contribute to elevations of postprandial insulin and basal insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plasma levels. It is the evolutional principle of mammalian milk to promote growth and support anabolic conditions for the neonate during the nursing period. Whey proteins are most potent inducers of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide secreted by enteroendocrine K cells which in concert",
    "Dietary intervention in acne\tThe purpose of this paper is to highlight the endocrine signaling of Western diet, a fundamental environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of epidemic acne. Western nutrition is characterized by high calorie uptake, high glycemic load, high fat and meat intake, as well as increased consumption of insulin- and IGF-1-level elevating dairy proteins. Metabolic signals of Western diet are sensed by the nutrient-sensitive kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which integrates signals of cellular energy, growth factors (insulin, IGF-1) and protein-derived signals, predominantly leucine, provided in high amounts by milk proteins and meat. mTORC1 activates SREBP, the",
    "Acne, dairy and cancer\tA potent link to dairy seems to exist for three hormone-responsive glands. Acne, breast cancer and prostate cancer have all been linked epidemiologically to dairy intake. Although mechanisms postulated here remain to be accurately defined, the likely link involves Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 as a general stimulant, synergized by the steroid hormones present in milk. The IGF-1 may be either absorbed from milk, or stimulated by its ingestion, or both. The 5alpha-reduced compound 5alpha-pregnanedione (5\u03b1-P) present in milk is a direct precursor of dihydrotestosterone and may act through that pathway in prostate cancer, but 5\u03b1-P has also recently been",
    "Metabolic disorders and breast cancer risk (United States).\tOBJECTIVE: To clarify the hormonal context of breast cancer etiology we used data from a large, population-based case-control study to investigate the relationship between breast cancer risk and a history of diabetes mellitus, disorders associated with estrogen stimulation (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, gallstones), and disorders associated with androgen stimulation (acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovaries). METHODS: Breast cancer patients between 50 and 75 years old were identified from state-wide tumor registries in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire; controls were randomly selected from drivers' license lists (age less than 65) or Medicare enrollment",
    "Acne vulgaris: a disease of Western civilization.\tBACKGROUND: In westernized societies, acne vulgaris is a nearly universal skin disease afflicting 79% to 95% of the adolescent population. In men and women older than 25 years, 40% to 54% have some degree of facial acne, and clinical facial acne persists into middle age in 12% of women and 3% of men. Epidemiological evidence suggests that acne incidence rates are considerably lower in nonwesternized societies. Herein we report the prevalence of acne in 2 nonwesternized populations: the Kitavan Islanders of Papua New Guinea and the Ach\u00e9 hunter-gatherers of Paraguay. Additionally, we analyze how elements in nonwesternized environments may influence",
    "High school dietary dairy intake and teenage acne.\tBACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest possible associations between Western diet and acne. We examined data from the Nurses Health Study II to retrospectively evaluate whether intakes of dairy foods during high school were associated with physician-diagnosed severe teenage acne. METHODS: We studied 47,355 women who completed questionnaires on high school diet in 1998 and physician-diagnosed severe teenage acne in 1989. We estimated the prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals of acne history across categories of intakes. RESULTS: After accounting for age, age at menarche, body mass index, and energy intake, the multivariate prevalence ratio (95% confidence intervals; P value for",
    "Milk consumption and acne in teenaged boys\tObjective We sought to examine the association between dietary dairy intake and teenaged acne among boys. Methods This was a prospective cohort study. We studied 4273 boys, members of a prospective cohort study of youths and of lifestyle factors, who reported dietary intake on up to 3 food frequency questionnaires from 1996 to 1998 and teenaged acne in 1999. We computed multivariate prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for acne. Results After adjusting for age at baseline, height, and energy intake, the multivariate prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval; P value for test of trend) for acne comparing highest (>2 servings/d) with",
    "Milk consumption and acne in adolescent girls.\tThere has been a remarkable paucity of evidence for an association between diet and acne. Our previous studies suggest that there is an association between milk intake and teenage acne. This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate that relationship. We studied 6,094 girls, aged 9-15 years in 1996, who reported dietary intake on up to three food frequency questionnaires from 1996 to 1998. Presence and severity of acne was assessed by questionnaire in 1999. We computed multivariate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95 percent confidence intervals for acne. After accounting for age at baseline, height and energy intake, the multivariate PRs (95 % CI"
