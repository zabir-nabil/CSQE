    "Chicken nuggets are a popular fast food item enjoyed by many, but have you ever wondered what exactly is in them? The main ingredient in chicken nuggets is, of course, chicken. Typically, nuggets are made from small pieces or ground chicken, which is then breaded and deep-fried. Other ingredients often found in chicken nuggets include flour, water, salt, and various seasonings for flavor. In some cases, preservatives and additives may also be used to extend shelf life or enhance texture. It's important to note that different brands and restaurants may use slightly different recipes and ingredients in their chicken nuggets, so it's always a good idea to check the label if you have any dietary concerns. Overall, while chicken nuggets are a tasty treat for many, it's important to consume them in moderation as they may not always be the healthiest option due to their high fat and calorie content.",
    "Chicken nuggets are a popular food item that typically consists of small pieces of chicken meat that are breaded and fried. The main ingredient in chicken nuggets is, unsurprisingly, chicken. However, the specific parts of the chicken used can vary depending on the brand and recipe. Chicken nuggets are usually made from a combination of white meat, such as chicken breast, and dark meat, such as chicken thigh meat. In addition to the chicken meat, chicken nuggets also contain a coating made from flour, breadcrumbs, and seasonings to give them their crunchy texture and flavor. Some chicken nuggets may also include added ingredients such as fillers, binders, and preservatives to help them maintain their shape and extend their shelf life. It's important to check the ingredients list on the packaging if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences."

    "The autopsy of chicken nuggets reads \"chicken little\".\tPURPOSE: To determine the contents of chicken nuggets from 2 national food chains. BACKGROUND: Chicken nuggets have become a major component of the American diet. We sought to determine the current composition of this highly processed food. METHODS: Randomly selected nuggets from 2 different national fast food chains were fixed in formalin, sectioned and stained for microscopic analysis. RESULTS: Striated muscle (chicken meat) was not the predominate component in either nugget. Fat was present in equal or greater quantities along with epithelium, bone, nerve, and connective tissue. CONCLUSION: Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a",
    "PHOSPHORUS CONTAINING FOOD ADDITIVES AND THE ACCURACY OF NUTRIENT DATABASES: IMPLICATIONS FOR RENAL PATIENTS\tObjective Phosphorus containing additives are increasingly added to food products. We sought to determine the potential impact of these additives. We focused on chicken products as an example. Methods We purchased a variety of chicken products, prepared them according to package directions, and performed laboratory analyses to determine their actual phosphorus content. We used ESHA Food Processor SQL Software to determine the expected phosphorus content of each product. Results Of 38 chicken products, 35 (92%) had phosphorus containing additives listed among their ingredients. For every category of chicken products containing additives, the actual phosphorus content was greater than the",
    "PCDD, PCDF, and PCB in farm-raised catfish from southeast United States--concentrations, sources, and CYP1A induction.\tNine catfish fillets, three catfish nuggets, two feed samples, and one pond sediment were analyzed for PCDD, PCDF, and PCB. Farm-raised catfish from Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas contained significant levels of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD and PCDF. In addition, a large number of non-2,3,7,8-substituted congeners were present in all samples. The catfish fillets and catfish nuggets also contained high concentrations of dioxin-like PCB, as well as a number of non-dioxin-like PCB. The TEQ based on PCDD and PCDF ranged from",
    "mTORC1 signaling: what we still don't know.\tThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that plays key roles in cellular regulation. It forms complexes with additional proteins. The best-understood one is mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The regulation and cellular functions of mTORC1 have been the subjects of intense study; despite this, many questions remain to be answered. They include questions about the actual mechanisms by which mTORC1 signaling is stimulated by hormones and growth factors, which involves the small GTPase Rheb, and by amino acids, which involves other GTPase proteins. The control of Rheb and the mechanism by which it activates mTORC1 remain incompletely understood",
    "Five years after To Err Is Human: what have we learned?\tFive years ago, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) called for a national effort to make health care safe. Although progress since then has been slow, the IOM report truly \"changed the conversation\" to a focus on changing systems, stimulated a broad array of stakeholders to engage in patient safety, and motivated hospitals to adopt new safe practices. The pace of change is likely to accelerate, particularly in implementation of electronic health records, diffusion of safe practices, team training, and full disclosure to patients following injury. If directed toward hospitals that actually achieve high levels of safety, pay for",
    "Organic food: buying more safety or just peace of mind? A critical review of the literature.\tConsumer concern over the quality and safety of conventional food has intensified in recent years, and primarily drives the increasing demand for organically grown food, which is perceived as healthier and safer. Relevant scientific evidence, however, is scarce, while anecdotal reports abound. Although there is an urgent need for information related to health benefits and/or hazards of food products of both origins, generalized conclusions remain tentative in the absence of adequate comparative data. Organic fruits and vegetables can be expected to contain fewer agrochemical residues than conventionally grown alternatives; yet, the significance of this difference is questionable",
    "Diet quality of preschool children and maternal perceptions/misperceptions: the GENESIS study.\tOBJECTIVES: To quantify maternal perceptions regarding the quality of their child's diet, and to identify factors associated with misperceptions. STUDY DESIGN: A representative sample of 2287 children aged 2-5 years from a cross-sectional study (GENESIS study) was used. METHODS: Maternal perceptions of the quality of their child's diet, child's and mother's anthropometric characteristics, and other characteristics (i.e. socio-demographic and lifestyle) were recorded. The actual quality of each child's diet was estimated using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score. RESULTS: Based on the HEI score",
    "Concentrations of antibiotic residues vary between different edible muscle tissues in poultry.\tAntibiotics are used by veterinarians and producers to treat disease and improve animal production. The federal government, to ensure the safety of the food supply, establishes antibiotic residue tolerances in edible animal tissues and determines the target tissues (e.g., muscle) for residue monitoring. However, when muscle is selected as the target tissue, the federal government does not specify which type of muscle tissue is used for monitoring (e.g., breast versus thigh). If specific muscle tissues incorporate residues at higher concentrations, these tissues should be selected for residue monitoring. To evaluate this possibility in poultry, chickens were divided into",
    "Cross-contamination versus undercooking of poultry meat or eggs - which risks need to be managed first?\tEpidemiological studies show that poultry meat and eggs are important sources for consumers' exposure to pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. There is a focus in many countries to reduce the level of human illness from food-borne pathogens. Reduction of the prevalence of contaminated poultry meat or eggs is one major area of focus. The other is risk communication to the consumer, where information aimed at changing the food preparation behaviour has been utilised as a risk management tool. The efficacy of messages such as 'cook poultry meat and eggs thoroughly' or 'wash your hands' will",
    "Initial contamination of chicken parts with Salmonella at retail and cross-contamination of cooked chicken with Salmonella from raw chicken during ...\tThe current study was undertaken to acquire data on contamination of chicken parts with Salmonella at retail and to acquire data on cross-contamination of cooked chicken with Salmonella from raw chicken during meal preparation. Whole raw chickens (n = 31) were obtained from local retail stores and cut into two wings, two breasts without skin or bones, two thighs, and two drumsticks. Data for cross-contamination were obtained by cutting up a sterile, cooked chicken breast with the same board and knife used to cut up the raw chicken. The board,"
