    "Bowel movement frequency varies among individuals and can be influenced by several factors such as diet, hydration, physical activity, and overall health. In general, a normal bowel movement frequency can range from multiple times a day to a few times a week. It is important to pay attention to any changes in your regular bowel habits as sudden increases or decreases in frequency, along with other symptoms like pain or blood in the stool, may indicate an underlying issue that requires medical attention. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fiber, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular physical activity can help promote healthy bowel movements. If you have concerns about your bowel movement frequency or any digestive issues, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider for guidance and appropriate management.",
    "Bowel movement frequency can vary from person to person and is influenced by a variety of factors. Generally, a normal bowel movement frequency ranges from three times a day to three times a week. However, what is regular for one person may not be the same for another. Factors such as diet, exercise, hydration, and overall health can impact how often one has a bowel movement. It is important to pay attention to any sudden changes in bowel habits, as this could be a sign of an underlying health issue that may require medical attention. If you have concerns about your bowel movement frequency, it is always best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and advice."

    "Bowel Movement Frequency OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between nutritional and lifestyle factors and bowel movement frequency. Results for each factor were adjusted for the other factors under investigation. The authors investigated the associations between bowel movement and constipation frequencies and colorectal cancer (CRC) endpoints among men. Multivariate analyses showed a significantly increased hazard ratio for CRC overall and rectal cancer in men who reported having a bowel movement 1-2 times per day. The relation between epithelial dysplasia in nipple aspirates of breast fluid and frequency of bowel movements was studied in 1481 white women. There was a significant positive association with dysplasia in women reporting severe constipation, i.e., two or fewer bowel movements weekly. Bowel movements provide vital information on how the body is functioning, and constipation among older adults is especially problematic. It is a function that nurses need to assess, support, and treat with the same attitude as when caring for patients with pain.",
    "Bowel Movement Frequency, Nutrition and lifestyle in relation to bowel movement frequency: a cross-sectional study of 20630 men and women in EPIC-Oxford. Mean numbers of bowel movements were calculated in relation to a range of factors. Individuals were categorized according to frequency of bowel movements: fewer than 7 per week ('less than daily') versus 7 or more per week ('daily'). The authors investigated the associations between bowel movement and constipation frequencies and colorectal cancer (CRC) endpoints among men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer. Multivariate analyses showed a significantly increased hazard ratio for CRC overall and rectal cancer in men who reported having a bowel movement 1-2 times per day. The relation between epithelial dysplasia in nipple aspirates of breast fluid and frequency of bowel movements was studied in 1481 white women. There was a significant positive association with dysplasia in women reporting severe constipation, i.e., two or fewer bowel movements weekly. Primary constipation is a consequence of habitual bowel elimination on common toilet seats. A considerable proportion of the population with normal bowel movement frequency has difficulty emptying their bowels. Bowel movements provide vital information on how the body is functioning, and constipation among older adults is especially problematic. Nurses need to assess, support, and treat bowel movements with care. Treatment of chronic constipation remains challenging with 50% of patients dissatisfied with current therapy. Aim to assess and compare the effects of dried plums and psyllium in patients with chronic constipation."

    "Nutrition and lifestyle in relation to bowel movement frequency: a cross-sectional study of 20630 men and women in EPIC-Oxford.\tOBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between nutritional and lifestyle factors and bowel movement frequency. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from a prospective study. Mean numbers of bowel movements were calculated in relation to a range of factors. In addition, individuals were categorised according to frequency of bowel movements: fewer than 7 per week ('less than daily') versus 7 or more per week ('daily'), and odds ratios were calculated from logistic regression models.

    "Bowel movement and constipation frequencies and the risk of colorectal cancer among men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer.\tThe authors investigated the associations between bowel movement and constipation frequencies and colorectal cancer (CRC) endpoints among men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer (n = 58,279) and explored whether dietary fiber intake may modify associations. After 13.3 years (1986-1999), 1,207 CRC cases and 1,753 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analyses. Multivariate analyses showed a significantly increased hazard ratio for CRC overall and rectal cancer in men who reported having a bowel movement 1-2 times per day (second-highest category) as compared",
    "Cytological abnormalities in nipple aspirates of breast fluid from women with severe constipation.\tThe relation between epithelial dysplasia in nipple aspirates of breast fluid and frequency of bowel movements was studied in 1481 white women. There was a significant positive association with dysplasia (risk ratio 4.5; 95% confidence interval 1.9-11.9) in women reporting severe constipation, i.e., two or fewer bowel movements weekly, which was not seen in women reporting more than one bowel movement daily. Women who had one bowel movement daily or one every other day had increased risk ratios. Cytological abnormalities in breast epithelium associated with severe constipation may be relevant to studies of diet and breast disease since the intestinal flora",

    "Primary constipation: an underlying mechanism.\tPrimary (simple) constipation is a consequence of habitual bowel elimination on common toilet seats. A considerable proportion of the population with normal bowel movement frequency has difficulty emptying their bowels, the principal cause of which is the obstructive nature of the recto-anal angle and its association with the sitting posture normally used in defecation. The only natural defecation posture for a human being is squatting. The alignment of the recto-anal angle associated with squatting permits smooth bowel elimination. This prevents excessive straining with the potential for resultant damage to the recto-anal region and, possibly, to the colon and other organs. There is no evidence",
    "Bowel movement: the sixth vital sign.\tBowel movements provide vital information on how the body is functioning, and constipation among older adults is especially problematic. Although we do not like hearing the details of someone else's bowel movement, it is a function that nurses need to assess, support, and treat with the same attitude as when caring for patients with pain.",

    "Intolerance of cow's milk and chronic constipation in children.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of intolerance of cow's milk among children. On the basis of a prior open study, we hypothesized that intolerance of cow's milk can also cause severe perianal lesions with pain on defecation and consequent constipation in young children. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, crossover study comparing cow's milk with soy milk in 65 children (age range, 11 to 72 months) with chronic constipation (defined as having one bowel movement every 3 to 15 days). All had been referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic and had previously been treated with laxatives",

There is an unmet need for natural and safe alternatives. Dried plums (prunes) have been used traditionally for constipation but their efficacy is not known. Aim To assess and compare the effects of dried plums and psyllium in patients with chronic constipation. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in an 8-week, single-blind, randomised cross-over study. Subjects received either dried plums (50 g b.d., fibre=6 gm/day) or psyllium (11 g b.d., fibre=6 gm/",
    "Combination of erythritol and fructose increases gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy adults.\tConsumption of a large amount of dietary fructose induces gastrointestinal intolerance, and glucose has been known as an enhancer of fructose absorption. Erythritol is a nonglycemic sugar alcohol, and it has been suggested that erythritol is absorbed paracellularly. It was hypothesized that paracellular absorption of erythritol could also enhance paracellular absorption of fructose in healthy adults. This is one of the proposed pathways for how additional glucose enhances the absorption of fructose. Thirty-seven nondiabetic, healthy adults participated in a randomized, double-masked, controlled crossover study. After an overnight fast, participants consumed beverages containing either 50 g fructose and 50 g glucose"
