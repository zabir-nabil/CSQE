    "Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process releases substances into the bloodstream that can be harmful to the kidneys and cause kidney damage. Common causes of rhabdomyolysis include severe muscle injury, certain medications, extreme physical exertion, and genetic muscle disorders. Symptoms may include muscle pain and weakness, dark urine, fatigue, and in severe cases, kidney failure. Treatment typically involves intravenous fluids to help flush out the toxins and prevent kidney damage. It is important to seek prompt medical attention if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, as early intervention can improve outcomes and prevent complications.",
    "Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle protein into the bloodstream. This can cause various symptoms such as muscle pain, weakness, and dark-colored urine due to the presence of myoglobin. Rhabdomyolysis is commonly caused by factors such as muscle injury, trauma, overexertion during exercise, certain medications, infections, and genetic disorders. If left untreated, rhabdomyolysis can lead to severe complications such as kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and even renal failure. Treatment usually involves intravenous fluids to help flush out the muscle proteins and support kidney function. It is important to seek medical attention promptly if rhabdomyolysis is suspected to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences."

    "Rhabdomyolysis associated with the use of a mislabeled \"acai berry\" dietary supplement.\tINTRODUCTION: This case report describes a patient who developed rhabdomyolysis temporally associated with the use of a mislabeled acai berry dietary supplement. METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors describe a 22-year-old man presenting with rhabdomyolysis approximately 2 weeks after starting a weight-loss dietary supplement. His medical history was significant only for hypertension treated with amlodipine. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was confirmed (creatine kinase, 84,000 IU/L, positive urine myoglobin) with other potential causes ruled out. The signs and symptoms of the patient gradually resolved and he was discharged on hospital day 5. Assessment using the",
    "Haff disease after eating salmon.\tWhile fish consumption is considered a component of a heart-healthy diet, many illnesses have been associated with eating contaminated fish. The authors describe two cases of muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis that occurred after eating salmon. Cases of rhabdomyolysis and muscle weakness after consumption of fresh water fish have rarely been reported in the United States but have been frequently reported from the Baltic region. This illness is known as Haff disease. While the etiology is unknown, it is felt to be a toxin. Palytoxin, found in marine fish, has been associated with rhabdomyolysis, and may serve as a model for further study of the suspected toxin responsible for rhabdomyolysis",
    "Acute rhabdomyolysis caused by Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis).\tRhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening disorder that occurs as a primary disease or as a complication of a broad spectrum of other diseases. We report the first case of acute rhabdomyolysis after ingestion of Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis), a plantonic blue-green alga, as a dietary supplement.",
    "Rhabdomyolysis from an intramuscular injection of glyphosate-surfactant herbicide.\tINTRODUCTION: Glyphosate-surfactant herbicide (GlySH) is widely used as a non-selective herbicide. Most intoxicated cases are from ingestion, inhalation, and skin exposure. Intramuscular injection of GlySH has never been reported. We present a case of GlySH intoxication via intramuscular injection. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old woman came to the emergency department complaining of painful swelling of left upper limb for 12 h. She had performed an intramuscular injection of 6 mL of GlySH over the lateral aspect of the left elbow 15 h previously. Physical examination disclosed painful swelling over left distal arm, elbow, and forearm with",
    "A case of fatal caffeine poisoning.\tCaffeine is a natural alkaloid methylxanthine that is found in various plants such as coffee or tea. Symptoms of a severe overdose may present with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, ventricular arrhythmias, hypertension followed by hypotension, respiratory failure, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, ventricular fibrillation and finally circulatory collapse. A 21-year-old woman called for the ambulance herself soon after the ingestion of about 10,000 mg of caffeine. At the arrival of the ambulance, the patient went into cardiac arrest almost immediately. After a total resuscitation period of 34 min including seven counter-shocks and 2 mg epinephrine, the patient was stable enough to be transferred to the hospital"
