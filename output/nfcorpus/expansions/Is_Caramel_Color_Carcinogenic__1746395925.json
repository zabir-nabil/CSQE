    "Caramel color is a widely used food coloring that is produced by heating sugar. While caramel color has been the subject of some concern regarding its safety, it is important to note that not all forms of caramel color are carcinogenic. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified one specific type of caramel color, known as Caramel Color III or 4-MEI, as possibly carcinogenic to humans when consumed in large amounts. This classification was based on animal studies and there is still ongoing research to determine the potential health risks associated with 4-MEI in humans. Other forms of caramel color, such as Caramel Color I and II, do not contain 4-MEI and are considered safe for consumption. It is advisable to consume caramel color in moderation and be mindful of potential exposure to 4-MEI in certain food and beverage products.",
    "Caramel color, which is commonly used as a food coloring agent, has been a topic of concern regarding its potential carcinogenic properties. The safety of caramel color has been a subject of debate among experts and regulatory agencies. While some studies have suggested that certain types of caramel color may contain compounds that have the potential to be carcinogenic, the overall consensus is that caramel color is safe for consumption in the amounts commonly found in food products.\n\nRegulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have set limits on the use of caramel color in food products to ensure its safety. Additionally, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified some specific types of caramel color as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" based on animal studies, but more research is needed to confirm these findings in humans.\n\nIt is essential to consider the overall diet and exposure to potential carcinogens from various sources when evaluating the safety of caramel color. As with any food additive, moderation is key, and consumers should follow dietary guidelines and regulations set by authorities to minimize any potential risks associated with caramel color consumption."

    "Is Caramel Color Carcinogenic? Carcinogenicity and regulation of caramel colorings. 2- and 4-methylimidazoles are present as contaminants in caramel colorings manufactured with ammonia catalysts. Both contaminants have been shown to induce cancer in animals and may be present in caramel colorings in amounts that exceed federal guidelines. California requires warning notices on products that could lead to consumption of more than 30 micrograms per day. The US Food and Drug Administration should bar the use of excessively contaminated caramel coloring in food. This review finds that all of the nine currently US-approved dyes raise health concerns of varying degrees. Red 3 causes cancer in animals, and there is evidence that several other dyes also are carcinogenic. Three dyes (Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6) have been found to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogens.",

    "Toxicology of food dyes.\tBACKGROUND: Food dyes, synthesized originally from coal tar and now petroleum, have long been controversial because of safety concerns. Many dyes have been banned because of their adverse effects on laboratory animals or inadequate testing. CONCLUSIONS: This review finds that all of the nine currently US-approved dyes raise health concerns of varying degrees. Red 3 causes cancer in animals, and there is evidence that several other dyes also are carcinogenic. Three dyes (Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6) have been found to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogens. At least four dyes (Blue 1, Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow",
    "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coffee brew samples: analytical method by GC-MS, profile, levels and sources.\tRoasting is a crucial step for the production of coffee, as it enables the development of color, aroma, and flavor, which are essential for the characterization of the coffee quality. At the same time, roasting may lead to the formation of not desirable compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this paper, we report a method for PAHs determination in coffee brew, based on saponification and liquid-liquid extraction with small volumes of hexane, with exclusion of further processes of purification since we analyze the extract by gas",
    "Berry fruits for cancer prevention: current status and future prospects.\tOverwhelming evidence suggests that edible small and soft-fleshed berry fruits may have beneficial effects against several types of human cancers. The anticancer potential of berries has been related, at least in part, to a multitude of bioactive phytochemicals that these colorful fruits contain, including polyphenols (flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, ellagitannins, gallotannins, phenolic acids), stilbenoids, lignans, and triterpenoids. Studies show that the anticancer effects of berry bioactives are partially mediated through their abilities to counteract, reduce, and also repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, berry bioactives also regulate carcinogen and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes,",
    "Well-done meat intake and the risk of breast cancer.\tBACKGROUND: Heterocyclic amines, mutagens formed in meats cooked at high temperatures, have been demonstrated as mammary carcinogens in animals. We conducted a nested, case-control study among 41836 cohort members of the Iowa Women's Health Study to evaluate the potential role of heterocyclic amines and intake of well-done meat in the risk for human breast cancer. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to individuals in the cohort who had breast cancer diagnosed during the period from 1992 through 1994 and a random sample of cancer-free cohort members to obtain information on usual intake of meats and on meat preparation practices.

    "Facial Skin Coloration Affects Perceived Health of Human Faces\tNumerous researchers have examined the effects of skin condition, including texture and color, on the perception of health, age, and attractiveness in human faces. They have focused on facial color distribution, homogeneity of pigmentation, or skin quality. We here investigate the role of overall skin color in determining perceptions of health from faces by allowing participants to manipulate the skin portions of color-calibrated Caucasian face photographs along CIELab color axes. To enhance healthy appearance, participants increased skin redness (a*), providing additional support for previous findings that skin blood color enhances the healthy appearance of faces. Participants also increased skin yellowness (",
    "You Are What You Eat: Within-Subject Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Confer Beneficial Skin-Color Changes\tBackground Fruit and vegetable consumption and ingestion of carotenoids have been found to be associated with human skin-color (yellowness) in a recent cross-sectional study. This carotenoid-based coloration contributes beneficially to the appearance of health in humans and is held to be a sexually selected cue of condition in other species. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we investigate the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on skin-color longitudinally to determine the magnitude and duration of diet change required to change skin-color perceptibly. Diet and skin-color were recorded at baseline and",
    "Iris color and macular pigment optical density.\tThe present study was designed to assess the relationship between iris color and macular pigment optical density. Both melanin and carotenoids (responsible for iris color and macular pigment composition, respectively) appear to protect the retina through similar mechanisms and higher concentrations may reduce the incidence of retinal degenerations. To evaluate this relationship, 95 subjects were examined and the following variables were measured: iris color; macular pigment optical density (MP); plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and beta-carotene; dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin and beta-carotene; and total fat intake. Iris color was determined by self assessment and classified as blue or",
    "Jam processing and storage effects on blueberry polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity.\tFresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained",
    "Synthetic Food Colors and Neurobehavioral Hazards: The View from Environmental Health Research\tBackground: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year"
