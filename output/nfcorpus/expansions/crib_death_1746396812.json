    "Crib death, also known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), is a devastating and unexplained phenomenon where an apparently healthy baby dies while sleeping. The cause of crib death is still not fully understood, but there are several factors that are believed to contribute to this tragic event. These factors may include abnormalities in the brain that control breathing and arousal from sleep, genetic factors, respiratory infections, and sleeping on the stomach or with soft bedding. It is important for parents to follow safe sleep practices to reduce the risk of SIDS, such as placing babies on their backs to sleep, using a firm mattress in a crib, and keeping soft objects and loose bedding out of the sleep area. Research continues to be done to better understand and prevent crib death in order to protect the lives of infants.",
    "Crib death, also known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), is a devastating occurrence that affects infants during their sleep. It is characterized by the sudden and unexpected death of an apparently healthy baby, typically under the age of one. The exact cause of crib death is not fully understood, but there are certain risk factors that have been identified, including sleeping on the stomach, exposure to smoke or alcohol during pregnancy, and overheating. To reduce the risk of crib death, experts recommend placing babies on their backs to sleep, ensuring a safe sleep environment free of loose bedding or toys, and avoiding exposure to harmful substances. Regular prenatal care and following safe sleep guidelines can help prevent this tragic event from occurring."

Activation of Caspase-8 on the aggregated receptor leads to apoptosis. Activation of apoptosis via death receptors is a tightly regulated event, and the death pathway itself is open to interference on the part of soluble or membrane-bound decoy receptors.

    "The Preventable Causes of Death in the United States: Comparative Risk Assessment of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Metabolic Risk Factors\tBackground Knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight\u2013obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol",
    "Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease S...\tBACKGROUND: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. METHODS: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries",
    "Overweight, obesity, and mortality from cancer in a prospectively studied cohort of U.S. adults.\tBACKGROUND: The influence of excess body weight on the risk of death from cancer has not been fully characterized. METHODS: In a prospectively studied population of more than 900,000 U.S. adults (404,576 men and 495,477 women) who were free of cancer at enrollment in 1982, there were 57,145 deaths from cancer during 16 years of follow-up. We examined the relation in men and women between the body-mass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers and from cancers at individual sites, while controlling for other risk factors in multivariate proportional-hazards models.

    "Cardiovascular mortality in men with erectile dysfunction: increased risk but not inevitable.\tINTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether men with erectile dysfunction (ED) ultimately die of cardiovascular (CV) causes. AIM: This study examined the causes of death in men with ED and their risk of CV death. METHODS: Based on statutory death registrations and hospital morbidity data, the risk of CV death in men with ED in a linked-data study was assessed against the CV mortality risk in a reference male population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths from CV causes as proportions of all deaths. Age-specific rate, mortality rate ratio (MRR), standardized mortality rate ratio (",
    "Apoptosis induced by death receptors.\tDeath receptors belong to the TNF receptor family and are characterised by an intracellular death domain that serves to recruit adapter proteins such as TRADD and FADD and cysteine proteases such as Caspase-8. Activation of Caspase-8 on the aggregated receptor leads to apoptosis. Triggering of death receptors is mediated through the binding of specific ligands of the TNF family, which are homotrimeric type-2 membrane proteins displaying three receptor binding sites. There are various means of modulating the activation of death receptors. The status of the ligand (membrane-bound vs. soluble) is critical in the activation of Fas and of TRAIL receptors. Cleavage of membrane-bound FasL to a soluble form (",

    "Death receptor ligands in tumors.\tActivation of apoptosis via death receptors is a tightly regulated event, and the death pathway itself is open to interference on the part of soluble or membrane-bound decoy receptors. The aggregation state of the death-inducing ligand is a crucial factor, particularly when these molecules are used as recombinant drugs against tumors. Whether tumors are sensitive to such ligands is determined by both the net abundance of death receptors versus decoy receptors and the balance between intracellular apoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms. This means that in vivo elimination of tumor cells by effector arms such as T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells is dependent on both the function",
    "Does Flavanol Intake Influence Mortality from Nitric Oxide-Dependent Processes? Ischemic Heart Disease, Stroke, Diabetes Mellitus, and Cancer in Panama\tSubstantial data suggest that flavonoid-rich food could help prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. Cocoa is the richest source of flavonoids, but current processing reduces the content substantially. The Kuna living in the San Blas drink a flavanol-rich cocoa as their main beverage, contributing more than 900 mg/day and thus probably have the most flavonoid-rich diet of any population. We used diagnosis on death certificates to compare cause-specific death rates from year 2000 to 2004 in mainland and the San Blas islands where only Kuna live. Our"
