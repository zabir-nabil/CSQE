    "Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. It can spread easily through contaminated food or water, contact with infected individuals, or touching surfaces that have the virus on them. Good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing and proper food handling, can help prevent norovirus outbreaks. If you suspect you have norovirus, it is important to stay hydrated and rest, but also to consult with a healthcare professional if symptoms persist or worsen.",
    "Norovirus, also known as the \"winter vomiting bug,\" is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis in humans. Symptoms of norovirus infection typically include sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. The virus is commonly transmitted through contaminated food or water, person-to-person contact, or touching surfaces with the virus on them. Proper hand hygiene, thorough cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, and avoiding close contact with infected individuals are important preventative measures. While norovirus infections are usually mild and resolve on their own, severe cases may require medical attention to prevent dehydration. It is important to stay hydrated and rest if you suspect you have contracted norovirus to help your body recover."

    "Epidemiology of Foodborne Norovirus Outbreaks, United States, 2001\u20132008\tNoroviruses are the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. To better guide interventions, we analyzed 2,922 foodborne disease outbreaks for which norovirus was the suspected or confirmed cause, which had been reported to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 2001\u20132008. On average, 365 foodborne norovirus outbreaks were reported annually, resulting in an estimated 10,324 illnesses, 1,247 health care provider visits, 156 hospitalizations, and 1 death.

    "Persistence of human norovirus in reconstituted pesticides--pesticide application as a possible source of viruses in fresh produce chains.\tThe consumption of fresh produce is frequently associated with outbreaks of human norovirus (hNoV) disease. To prevent the contamination of fresh produce with hNoV, knowledge of the possible introduction sources of the viruses, such as water, is needed to be able to implement appropriate and efficient preventive measures. Contaminated water used to reconstitute pesticides could be a relevant source of infectious hNoV, determined by the initial level of virus contamination and the persistence of these viruses in reconstituted pesticides. We studied the persistence of hNoV GI.4, hNoV GII.4 and murine norovirus (MNV-1), the",
    "Editorial: From the acute infection to the chronic disorder \"Don't worry it's just a viral gastroenteritis\".\tPostinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders (PI-FGID) have become a category in the general FGID classification. Bacterial PI-FGID has been well documented in several studies and meta-analysis. Increased risk does not appear to be confined to bacterial gastroenteritis (GE), also protozoan and helminth infections are sometimes followed by PI-FGID. In this issue of the journal, Zanini et al. provides evidence that Norovirus GE also leads to the development of PI-irritable bowel syndrome in a substantial proportion of patients.",
    "Annual cost of illness and quality-adjusted life year losses in the United States due to 14 foodborne pathogens.\tIn this article we estimate the annual cost of illness and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss in the United States caused by 14 of the 31 major foodborne pathogens reported on by Scallan et al. (Emerg. Infect. Dis. 17:7-15, 2011), based on their incidence estimates of foodborne illness in the United States. These 14 pathogens account for 95 % of illnesses and hospitalizations and 98 % of deaths due to identifiable pathogens estimated by Scallan et al. We estimate that these 14 pathogens cause $14.0 billion (ranging from",
    "Ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the United States using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elic...\tUnderstanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system. This study was conducted to estimate the U.S. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. These pathogens examined were Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, Salmonella enterica, Toxoplasma gondii, and all other FoodNet pathogens. The health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of"
