    "Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indigenous Americans, and other terms, are the Indigenous peoples of the United States. They encompass a diverse array of tribes, cultures, and languages, each with their own unique traditions and histories. Native Americans have inhabited the land now known as the United States for thousands of years, long before the arrival of European settlers. Despite centuries of colonization, displacement, and discrimination, many Native American communities continue to preserve their heritage and identities through art, language, and activism. Today, Native Americans are making significant contributions to American society in various fields, while also advocating for their rights and sovereignty. Acknowledging the profound impact of colonialism and working towards reconciliation are crucial steps in honoring and respecting the resilience of Native American communities.",
    "Native Americans are the indigenous peoples of North America, including the United States, Canada, and other regions. They have a rich cultural heritage that includes traditional languages, beliefs, and customs that have been passed down through generations. Native American tribes have diverse histories and lifestyles, each with its own unique traditions and way of life. Despite facing centuries of oppression and discrimination, many Native American communities continue to preserve their cultures and strive for recognition and justice. It is important to respect and honor the contributions and resilience of Native Americans, while also working towards a more inclusive and equitable society for all."

    "Native Americans, Lower Serum Testosterone Associated with Elevated Polychlorinated Biphenyl Concentrations in Native American Men We studied the relationship between serum concentrations of testosterone in relation to levels of PCBs and three chlorinated pesticides in an adult Native American (Mohawk) population. Why do African Americans get more colon cancer than Native Africans? To explore whether the difference could be explained by interactions between diet and colonic bacterial flora, we compared randomly selected samples of healthy 50- to 65-y-old AAs (African Americans) with NAs (Native Africans) and CAs (Caucasian Americans). Products of the colonic microbiota mediate the effects of diet on colon cancer risk. To validate this further, we compared colonic contents from healthy 50- to 65-y-old people from populations with high and low risk, specifically low risk Native Africans (cancer incidence <1:100,000; n = 17), high risk African Americans (risk 65:100,000; n = 17), and Caucasian Americans (risk 50:100,000; n =",
    "Native Americans, Lower Serum Testosterone Associated with Elevated Polychlorinated Biphenyl Concentrations in Native American Men. We collected fasting serum samples from 703 adult Mohawks (257 men and 436 women) and analyzed samples for 101 PCB congeners, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and mirex, as well as testosterone, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Why do African Americans get more colon cancer than Native Africans? The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is dramatically higher in African Americans (AAs) than in Native Africans (NAs) (60:100,000 vs. <1:100,000) and slightly higher than in Caucasian Americans (CAs). Products of the colonic microbiota mediate the effects of diet on colon cancer risk. To validate this further, we compared colonic contents from healthy 50- to 65-y-old people from populations with high and low risk, specifically low risk Native Africans and high risk African Americans."

    "Diet, microbiota, and microbial metabolites in colon cancer risk in rural Africans and African Americans\tBackground: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic colon cancer can be attributed to diet. The recognition that colonic microbiota have a major influence on colonic health suggests that they might mediate colonic carcinogenesis. Objective: To examine the hypothesis that the influence of diet on colon cancer risk is mediated by the microbiota through their metabolites, we measured differences in colonic microbes and their metabolites in African Americans with a high risk and in rural native Africans with a low risk of colon cancer. Design: Fresh fecal samples were collected from 12 healthy African Americans aged 50\u201365 y and from 12",
    "Lower Serum Testosterone Associated with Elevated Polychlorinated Biphenyl Concentrations in Native American Men\tBackground Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides are endocrine disruptors, altering both thyroid and estrogen hormonal systems. Less is known of action on androgenic systems. Objective We studied the relationship between serum concentrations of testosterone in relation to levels of PCBs and three chlorinated pesticides in an adult Native American (Mohawk) population. Methods We collected fasting serum samples from 703 adult Mohawks (257 men and 436 women) and analyzed samples for 101 PCB congeners, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and mirex, as well as testosterone, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

    "Products of the colonic microbiota mediate the effects of diet on colon cancer risk.\tIt is estimated that most colon cancers can be attributed to dietary causes. We have hypothesized that diet influences the health of the colonic mucosa through interaction with the microbiota and that it is the milieu interior that regulates mucosal proliferation and therefore cancer risk. To validate this further, we compared colonic contents from healthy 50- to 65-y-old people from populations with high and low risk, specifically low risk Native Africans (cancer incidence <1:100,000; n = 17), high risk African Americans (risk 65:100,000; n = 17), and Caucasian Americans (risk 50:100,000; n =",

    "Cancer risks in second-generation immigrants to Sweden.\tWe used the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to analyze cancer risks in Sweden-born descendants of immigrants from European and North American countries. Our study included close to 600,000 0-66-year-old descendants of an immigrant father or mother. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 17 cancer sites using native Swedes as a reference. All cancer was marginally below the Swedish incidence in offspring of immigrant origin. Decreased SIRs were observed for breast cancer among Norwegian descendants, melanoma among descendants of Hungarian fathers and ovarian and bladder cancer among descendents of Finnish mothers,",
    "Analysis of risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm in a cohort of more than 3 million individuals.\tBACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk. METHODS: We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We observed a positive association with increasing years of",
    "Assessment of endogenous androgen levels in meat, liver and testis of Iranian native cross-breed male sheep and bull by gas chromatography-mass spe...\tAndrogenic steroids always exist in different animal tissues at trace level, with significant numbers of interfering compounds, which makes their determination difficult. To solve some of the problems in quantification of the natural steroids in those tissues, a new GC-MS method was developed in this study. By using a surrogate analyte approach, which was developed in the authors' previous studies, and extensive sample preparation procedure, which successfully eliminates many of the interfering compounds and resulting in a cleaner extract, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and selectivity of",
    "Optimal low-density lipoprotein is 50 to 70 mg/dl: lower is better and physiologically normal.\tThe normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol range is 50 to 70 mg/dl for native hunter-gatherers, healthy human neonates, free-living primates, and other wild mammals (all of whom do not develop atherosclerosis). Randomized trial data suggest atherosclerosis progression and coronary heart disease events are minimized when LDL is lowered to <70 mg/dl. No major safety concerns have surfaced in studies that lowered LDL to this range of 50 to 70 mg/dl. The current guidelines setting the target LDL at 100 to 115 mg/dl",
    "Property rights and genetic engineering: developing nations at risk.\tEighty percent of (commercial) genetically engineered seeds (GES) are designed only to resist herbicides. Letting farmers use more chemicals, they cut labor costs. But developing nations say GES cause food shortages, unemployment, resistant weeds, and extinction of native cultivars when \"volunteers\" drift nearby. While GES patents are reasonable, this paper argues many patent policies are not. The paper surveys GE technology, outlines John Locke's classic account of property rights, and argues that current patent policies must be revised to take account of Lockean ethical constraints. After answering a key objection, it provides concrete suggestions for implementing",
    "Dietary sources and antioxidant effects of ergothioneine.\tErgothioneine is a native membrane-impermeable thiol compound that is specifically accumulated in cells via the organic cation transporter OCTN1. In humans, OCTN1 and ergothioneine have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. However, available evidence about dietary sources and the functional role of ergothioneine in human physiology is scarce. Here, we analyzed the ergothioneine content in common foods using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we assessed the protective potency of ergothioneine against various oxidative stressors in OCTN1-expressing cells in comparison with the main intracellular thiol antioxidant glutathione by evaluating cell viability with the MTT reduction assay. Only some food contained ergothioneine with highest"
