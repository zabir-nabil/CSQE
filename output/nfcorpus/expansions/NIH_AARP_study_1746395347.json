    "The NIH-AARP study, conducted by the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with the American Association of Retired Persons, is a landmark research project aimed at investigating various factors that influence health and wellness in older adults. This long-term study follows a large cohort of participants over an extended period of time, collecting data on lifestyle habits, diet, physical activity, and medical history to better understand how these factors impact the aging process and the development of chronic diseases. By analyzing the wealth of information gathered through the NIH-AARP study, researchers hope to uncover valuable insights that can inform public health strategies and interventions designed to promote healthy aging and prevent disease in older populations.",
    "The NIH-AARP study, conducted by the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with the American Association of Retired Persons, is a landmark research initiative aimed at investigating the relationship between lifestyle factors and health outcomes in aging individuals. This longitudinal study has provided valuable insights into the impact of diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle choices on various health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive decline. The large and diverse population included in the study has allowed researchers to draw significant conclusions and make recommendations for promoting healthy aging. The findings from the NIH-AARP study continue to inform public health policies and initiatives aimed at improving the overall well-being of older adults."

    "Diet, Lifestyle, and Acute Myeloid Leukemia in the NIH\u2013AARP Cohort\tThe relation between diet, lifestyle, and acute myeloid leukemia was assessed in a US cohort of 491,163 persons from the NIH\u2013AARP Diet and Health Study (1995\u20132003). A total of 338 incident cases of acute myeloid leukemia were ascertained. Multivariate Cox models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Compared with those for never smokers, hazard ratios were 1.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.75), 1.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.32, 2.42), 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.63, 3.57), and 2.29 (85% confidence",
    "Dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite and risk of renal cell carcinoma in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study\tBackground: Nitrate and nitrite are present in many foods and are precursors of N-nitroso compounds, known animal carcinogens and potential human carcinogens. We prospectively investigated the association between nitrate and nitrite intake from dietary sources and risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) overall and clear cell and papillary histological subtypes in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Methods: Nitrate and nitrite intakes were estimated from a 124-item food frequency questionnaire. Over a mean follow-up of 9 years, we identified 1816 RCC cases (n=498, clear cell; n=115",
    "Intensity and timing of physical activity in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer risk: the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study\tBackground Despite strong evidence of an inverse association of physical activity with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, whether a certain intensity or time of life of physical activity is most effective for lowering breast cancer risk is not known. Methods In 118,899 postmenopausal women in the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, we examined the relations of light and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during four periods of life (\"historical\": ages 15-18, 19-29, 35-39 years; \"recent\": past 10 years) to",
    "Meat and components of meat and the risk of bladder cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study\tBackground Meat could be involved in bladder carcinogenesis via multiple potentially carcinogenic meat-related compounds related to cooking and processing, including nitrate, nitrite, heterocyclic amines (HCAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We comprehensively investigated the association between meat and meat components and bladder cancer. Methods During 7 years of follow-up, 854 transitional cell bladder cancer cases were identified among 300,933 men and women who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire in the large prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. We estimated intake of nitrate and nitrite from processed meat and HCAs and PAHs",
    "Dietary Fatty Acids and Pancreatic Cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study\tBackground Previous research relating dietary fat, a modifiable risk factor, to pancreatic cancer has been inconclusive. Methods We prospectively analyzed the association between intakes of fat, fat subtypes, and fat food sources and exocrine pancreatic cancer in the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP Diet and Health Study, a US cohort of 308\u2009736 men and 216\u2009737 women who completed a 124-item food frequency questionnaire in 1995\u20131996. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, with adjustment for energy intake, smoking history, body mass",
    "Sweetened Beverages, Coffee, and Tea and Depression Risk among Older US Adults\tSweetened beverages, coffee, and tea are the most consumed non-alcoholic beverages and may have important health consequences. We prospectively evaluated the consumption of various types of beverages assessed in 1995\u20131996 in relation to self-reported depression diagnosis after 2000 among 263,923 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from multivariate logistic regressions. The OR (95% CI) comparing \u22654 cans/cups per day with none were 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17\u20131.44) for soft drinks, 1.38 (1.15\u20131.65) for fruit drinks,",
    "Intake of fiber and fiber-rich plant foods is associated with a lower risk of renal cell carcinoma in a large US cohort\tBackground: Plant-based and fiber-rich diets high in vegetables, fruit, and whole grains are recommended to prevent cancer and chronic conditions associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Diet may play a role in the etiology of RCC directly and/or indirectly. Objective: In a large prospective cohort of US men and women, we comprehensively investigated dietary intake and food sources of fiber in relation to RCC risk. Design: Participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (n =",
    "Higher Diet Quality Is Associated with Decreased Risk of All-Cause, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer Mortality among Older Adults\tIncreased attention in dietary research and guidance has been focused on dietary patterns, rather than on single nutrients or food groups, because dietary components are consumed in combination and correlated with one another. However, the collective body of research on the topic has been hampered by the lack of consistency in methods used. We examined the relationships between 4 indices\u2014the Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (HEI-2010), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)\u2014and all-cause, cardiovascular disease",
    "Meat intake and mortality: a prospective study of over half a million people\tContext High intakes of red or processed meat may increase risk of mortality. Objective Determine the relations of red, white and processed meat intakes to risk for total, and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort of half a million people aged 50-71 years at baseline. Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the models were: age; education",
    "Relationship between funding sources and outcomes of obesity-related research.\tThis study examined the relationship between funding sources and the outcomes of published obesity-related research. A list of funded projects for human nutrition research linking food intake to obesity in 2001-2005 was drawn from two distinct sources: (a) the federal government's semi-public generic commodity promotion or \"checkoff\" programs for Fluid Milk and Dairy and (b) the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Principal Investigator for each funded project was determined. Published literature by that individual was located using an Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed author search. All articles related to both dairy and obesity were included"
