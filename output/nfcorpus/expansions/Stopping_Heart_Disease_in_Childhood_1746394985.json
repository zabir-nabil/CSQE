    "Heart disease, a leading cause of death around the world, is increasingly affecting individuals at a younger age. Prevention strategies must begin in childhood to combat this growing issue. One of the key approaches to stopping heart disease in childhood is promoting healthy lifestyle habits. Encouraging children to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, while limiting sugary drinks and high-fat, high-calorie foods, plays a crucial role in preventing the development of risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Moreover, engaging children in regular physical activity, such as biking, swimming, or participating in sports, helps maintain a healthy weight, strengthens the heart and cardiovascular system, and reduces the likelihood of heart disease later in life. Educating children about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including the harmful effects of smoking and the benefits of good sleep hygiene, also empowers them to make informed choices for their long-term heart health. By instilling healthy habits early on, we can significantly decrease the incidence of heart disease in childhood and pave the way for a healthier future generation.",
    "Preventing heart disease in childhood is crucial for ensuring a healthy future for our young ones. By incorporating healthy lifestyle habits from an early age, we can significantly reduce the risk of developing heart-related issues later in life. Encouraging children to consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help maintain a healthy weight and promote cardiovascular health. Additionally, promoting regular physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviors such as excessive screen time can further support heart health. Educating children about the importance of these habits and providing a supportive environment at home and in school can go a long way in stopping heart disease in childhood. By prioritizing preventive measures and instilling healthy habits early on, we can help our children lead long and heart-healthy lives."

    "Does childhood meat eating contribute to sex differences in risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in a developing population?\tBACKGROUND: A male epidemic of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) emerges with economic development. It has previously been hypothesised that this epidemic is due to nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex steroids, which lead to a more atherogenic body shape and lipid profile in boys but not girls, without any sex-specific effects on glucose metabolism. This study tests this hypothesis by examining the association of childhood meat eating with IHD risk in a developing Chinese population. METHODS: Multivariable linear and censored regression was used in a cross-sectional study of 19,418 Chinese older (\u2265 50",
    "Strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes: an update for clinicians\tDiabetes is a major and growing public health challenge which threatens to overwhelm medical services in the future. Type 2 diabetes confers significant morbidity and mortality, most notably with target organ damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. The magnitude of cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is best illustrated by its position as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. Complications related to neuropathy are also vast, often working in concert with vascular abnormalities and resulting in serious clinical consequences such as foot ulceration. Increased understanding of the natural history of this disorder has generated the potential to intervene and halt pathological progression before overt disease ensues,",

    "Pathobiological determinants of atherosclerosis in youth risk scores are associated with early and advanced atherosclerosis.\tOBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses during adolescence and young adulthood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study previously reported risk scores to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in young individuals aged 15 to 34 years using the coronary heart disease risk factors (gender, age, serum lipoprotein concentrations, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycemia). In this study we investigated the relation of these risk scores to the early atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: We measured atherosclerotic lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery, and abdominal aorta and the coronary heart disease",

No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time.

    "Excessive Leucine-mTORC1-Signalling of Cow Milk-Based Infant Formula: The Missing Link to Understand Early Childhood Obesity\tIncreased protein supply by feeding cow-milk-based infant formula in comparison to lower protein content of human milk is a well-recognized major risk factor of childhood obesity. However, there is yet no conclusive biochemical concept explaining the mechanisms of formula-induced childhood obesity. It is the intention of this article to provide the biochemical link between leucine-mediated signalling of mammalian milk proteins and adipogenesis as well as early adipogenic programming. Leucine has been identified as the predominant signal transducer of mammalian milk, which stimulates the nutrient-sensitive kinase mammalian target of"
