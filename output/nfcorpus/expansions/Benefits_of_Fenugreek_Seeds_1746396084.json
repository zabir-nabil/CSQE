With their versatile culinary uses and numerous health benefits, incorporating fenugreek seeds into your diet can be a simple and effective way to boost your overall health.",
    "Fenugreek seeds, a popular ingredient in various cuisines and traditional medicine, offer numerous health benefits. These small, golden seeds are rich in nutrients such as protein, fiber, iron, and magnesium. One of the main advantages of fenugreek seeds is their potential to improve blood sugar control, making them beneficial for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Additionally, fenugreek seeds are believed to promote heart health by reducing cholesterol levels and inflammation in the body. They also have been linked to increased milk production in breastfeeding mothers. Furthermore, fenugreek seeds may aid digestion, support weight management, and even provide relief from menstrual discomfort. Incorporating fenugreek seeds into your diet can be a simple way to take advantage of these various health benefits and enhance your overall well-being."

    "Benefits of Fenugreek Seeds Ingstion of fenugreek by mothers during labor resulted in a maple syrup-like odor in their newborn infants, leading to a false suspicion of MSUD. Chickpea is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, with significant amounts of essential amino acids. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fiber, oligosaccharides, and simple sugars like glucose and sucrose.",

    "Pseudo-maple syrup urine disease due to maternal prenatal ingestion of fenugreek.\tFenugreek, maple syrup and the urine of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients all share a characteristic odour originating from a common component, sotolone. Ingestion of fenugreek by mothers during labour resulted in a maple syrup-like odour in their newborn infants, leading to a false suspicion of MSUD.",
    "The fruit of the date palm: its possible use as the best food for the future?\tThe fruits (dates) of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) contain a high percentage of carbohydrate (total sugars, 44-88%), fat (0.2-0.5%), 15 salts and minerals, protein (2.3-5.6%), vitamins and a high percentage of dietary fibre (6.4-11.5%). The flesh of dates contains 0.2-0.5% oil, whereas the seed contains 7.7-9.7% oil. The weight of the seed is 5.6-14.2% of the date. The fatty acids occur in both flesh and",
    "Nutritional quality and health benefits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.): a review.\tChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important pulse crop grown and consumed all over the world, especially in the Afro-Asian countries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, and protein quality is considered to be better than other pulses. Chickpea has significant amounts of all the essential amino acids except sulphur-containing amino acids, which can be complemented by adding cereals to the daily diet. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fibre, oligosaccharides and simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Although lipids are present in low amounts, chickpea is rich in nutritionally",
    "Effect of non-oil-seed pulses on glycaemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled experimental trials in people wi...\tAIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary non-oil-seed pulses (chickpeas, beans, peas, lentils, etc.) are a good source of slowly digestible carbohydrate, fibre and vegetable protein and a valuable means of lowering the glycaemic-index (GI) of the diet. To assess the evidence that dietary pulses may benefit glycaemic control, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled experimental trials investigating the effect of pulses, alone or as part of low-GI or high-fibre diets,",
    "Flaxseed: a potential source of food, feed and fiber.\tFlaxseed is one of the most important oilseed crops for industrial as well as food, feed, and fiber purposes. Almost every part of the flaxseed plant is utilized commercially, either directly or after processing. The stem yields good quality fiber having high strength and durability. The seed provides oil rich in omega-3, digestible proteins, and lignans. In addition to being one of the richest sources of \u03b1-linolenic acid oil and lignans, flaxseed is an essential source of high quality protein and soluble fiber and has considerable potential as a source of phenolic compounds. Flaxseed is emerging as an important functional food ingredient",
    "Nutritional quality of legumes, and their role in cardiometabolic risk prevention: a review.\tLegumes (including alfalfa, clover, lupins, green beans and peas, peanuts, soybeans, dry beans, broad beans, dry peas, chickpeas, and lentils) represent an important component of the human diet in several areas of the world, especially in the developing countries, where they complement the lack of proteins from cereals, roots, and tubers. In some regions of the world, legume seeds are the only protein supply in the diet. The health benefits of legume consumption have received rising interest from researchers, and their consumption and production extends worldwide. Among European countries,",
    "Microbiological examination of vegetable seed sprouts in Korea.\tSprouted vegetable seeds used as food have been implicated as sources of outbreaks of Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections. We profiled the microbiological quality of sprouts and seeds sold at retail shops in Seoul, Korea. Ninety samples of radish sprouts and mixed sprouts purchased at department stores, supermarkets, and traditional markets and 96 samples of radish, alfalfa, and turnip seeds purchased from online stores were analyzed to determine the number of total aerobic bacteria (TAB) and molds or yeasts (MY) and the incidence of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Enterobacter sakazakii. Significantly higher numbers of TAB (7.52 log",
    "Optimized LC/MS/MS analysis of morphine and codeine in poppy seed and evaluation of their fate during food processing as a basis for risk analysis.\tThe opiate alkaloids present in poppy seed intended for use in food recently have raised major concerns. An efficient method for routine analysis of morphine and codeine using liquid chromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole instrument (LC/MS/MS) was therefore developed. The optimal sample preparation was found to be cold extraction of 10 g of unground poppy seed with 30 mL of methanol containing 0.1% acetic acid for 60 min shaken at 250 rpm. The fate of morphine during food processing was also studied",
    "Morphine levels in urine subsequent to poppy seed consumption.\tUrine morphine levels after the consumption of poppy seeds were measured in two separate trials. Maximum levels of approximately 18 micrograms/ml were found using RIA, EMIT-ST and GC methodologies. Positive immunoassay results were seen up to 60 h post-ingestion. Several different lots of seeds from various sources were assayed for morphine and found to range from 4-200 mg/kg. Differentiation of poppy seed eaters from opiate users was not possible via the identification of minor alkaloid constituents of poppy seeds. It is, however, possible to analyse opiate urines with respect to 6-O-acetylmorphine. Below the level",
    "Poppy seed foods and opiate drug testing--where are we today?\tSeeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids. The objective of this study is to review the toxicology of poppy seed foods regarding influence on opiate drug tests. Computer-assisted literature review resulted in 95 identified references. Normal poppy seed consumption is generally regarded as safe. During food processing, the morphine content is considerably reduced (up to 90%). The possibility of false-positive opiate drug tests after poppy food ingestion exists. There are no unambiguous markers available to differentiate poppy"
