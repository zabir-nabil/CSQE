    "A hernia is a medical condition that occurs when an organ or fatty tissue pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue. This can result in a noticeable bulge or lump, typically in the abdomen or groin area. Hernias can cause discomfort, pain, and potentially serious complications if left untreated. Common types of hernias include inguinal hernias (in the groin), umbilical hernias (around the belly button), and hiatal hernias (in the upper stomach). Treatment for a hernia may involve surgery to repair the weakened area and prevent further protrusion of tissue. It's important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have a hernia to receive proper diagnosis and treatment.",
    "A hernia is a medical condition that occurs when an organ or tissue protrudes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle or connective tissue. This protrusion often results in a visible bulge or swelling, accompanied by pain or discomfort. Hernias can develop in various parts of the body, including the abdomen, groin, and diaphragm. Common types of hernias include inguinal hernias, umbilical hernias, and hiatal hernias. Treatment for a hernia may involve lifestyle changes, such as weight management and proper lifting techniques, as well as surgical intervention in severe cases. If you suspect you have a hernia, it is important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and recommendations for management."

    "Prevalence of diverticular disease, hiatus hernia, and pelvic phleboliths in black and white Americans.\tPhleboliths, and especially diverticular disease and hiatus hernia, are rarer in developing countries than in economically more developed communities, but all three conditions were as common in Black as in White Americans. This finding suggests that they are due to environmental rather than to genetic causes. A deficient intake of dietary fibre may be the common factor predisposing to these three conditions.",
    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for newborn respiratory failure: forty-five cases.\tAlmost all types of newborn respiratory failure are reversible. However, supportive treatment (oxygen and positive airway pressure) can damage the lung, and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infants. Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to \"rest.\" We have used ECMO in 45 moribund newborn infants; 25 survived. Neonatologists referred patients who were unresponsive to maximal therapy. The right atrium and aortic arch were cannulated via the jugular vein and carotid artery. Heparin was infused continuously to main activated clotting time at 200 to 300 seconds."
