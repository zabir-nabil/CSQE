    "Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that can have negative health effects when consumed in excess. They are formed through a process called hydrogenation, which involves adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid at room temperature. This process can increase the shelf life and improve the flavor of foods, which is why trans fats are commonly found in processed and fried foods.\n\nConsuming high levels of trans fats has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious health issues. In response to these concerns, many countries have implemented regulations to limit the amount of trans fats in food products. Health experts recommend reducing intake of trans fats by opting for healthier fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in foods such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil. By making small changes to your diet and choosing healthier options, you can help protect your heart and overall well-being.",
    "Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat that can have negative effects on health when consumed in excess. These fats are typically found in processed foods, such as baked goods, fried foods, and certain types of margarine. Consuming trans fats can increase levels of \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) in the blood, which in turn raises the risk of heart disease and stroke. In light of these health concerns, many health organizations recommend limiting or avoiding the consumption of trans fats altogether. Check food labels and ingredients lists to make informed choices and prioritize foods that are free of trans fats for a healthier diet."

    "trans fats Updated estimate of trans fat intake by the US population. The dietary intake of industrially-produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFA) was estimated for the US population. Using the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) food consumption database. Tolerable upper intake levels for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) did not set ULs for trans fat. Because any intake level above 0% of energy increased LDL cholesterol concentration.

    "trans fats The dietary intake of industrially-produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFA) was estimated for the US population using the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) food consumption database, market share information, and trans fat levels based on label survey data and analytical data for packaged and in-store purchased foods. We sought to determine whether dietary trans fatty acids (dTFA) are associated with aggression/irritability. dTFA inhibit the production of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce aggression. The objective was to evaluate the association between trans-fatty acids intake from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO), partially hydrogenated fish oils (PHFO) and ruminant fat (rTFA) and risks of death from cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and sudden death in the Norwegian Counties Study. They include emphasizing healthful unsaturated fats, whole grains, good protein 'packages', and fruits and vegetables; limiting consumption of trans and saturated fats, highly refined grains, and sugary beverages."

    "Updated estimate of trans fat intake by the US population.\tThe dietary intake of industrially-produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFA) was estimated for the US population (aged 2 years or more), children (aged 2-5 years) and teenage boys (aged 13-18 years) using the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) food consumption database, market share information and trans fat levels based on label survey data and analytical data for packaged and in-store purchased foods. For fast foods, a Monte Carlo model was used to estimate IP-TFA intake. Further, the intake of trans fat was also estimated",
    "Tolerable upper intake levels for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\tTolerable upper intake levels (ULs) set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are important, in part because they are used for estimating the percentage of the population at potential risk of adverse effects from excessive nutrient intake. The IOM did not set ULs for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol because any intake level above 0% of energy increased LDL cholesterol concentration and these three food components are unavoidable in ordinary diets. The purpose of the analysis presented in this review was to evaluate clinical trial and prospective observational data that were not previously considered for setting a UL with the aim of",
    "Post-diagnosis dietary factors and survival after invasive breast cancer\tLittle is known about the effects of diet after breast cancer diagnosis on survival. We prospectively examined the relation between post-diagnosis dietary factors and breast cancer and all-cause survival in women with a history of invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1987 and 1999 (at ages 20\u201379 years). Diet after breast cancer diagnosis was measured using a 126-item food frequency questionnaire. Among 4,441 women without a history of breast cancer recurrence prior to completing the questionnaire, 137 subsequently died from breast cancer within 7 years of enrollment. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for intake",
    "Plasma and erythrocyte biomarkers of dairy fat intake and risk of ischemic heart disease.\tBACKGROUND: The relation between dairy product intake and the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore biomarkers of dairy fat intake in plasma and erythrocytes and to assess the hypothesis that higher concentrations of these biomarkers are associated with a greater risk of IHD in US women. DESIGN: Among 32,826 participants in the Nurses' Health Study who provided blood samples in 1989-1990, 166 incident cases of IHD were ascertained between baseline and 1996. These cases were matched with 327 controls for age, smoking, fasting status, and date of blood drawing.",
    "Dietary fat types and 4-year cognitive change in community-dwelling older women\tObjective To relate dietary fat types to cognitive change in healthy community-based elders. Methods Among 6,183 older participants in the Women\u2019s Health Study, we related intake of major fatty acids (FAs) (saturated [SFA], mono-unsaturated [MUFA], total poly-unsaturated [PUFA], trans-unsaturated) to late-life cognitive trajectory. Serial cognitive testing, conducted over 4 years, began 5 years post-dietary assessment. Primary outcomes were global cognition (averaging tests of general cognition, verbal memory and semantic fluency) and verbal memory (averaging tests of",
    "Trans Fat Consumption and Aggression\tBackground Dietary trans fatty acids (dTFA) are primarily synthetic compounds that have been introduced only recently; little is known about their behavioral effects. dTFA inhibit production of omega-3 fatty acids, which experimentally have been shown to reduce aggression. Potential behavioral effects of dTFA merit investigation. We sought to determine whether dTFA are associated with aggression/irritability. Methodolgy/Prinicpal Findings We capitalized on baseline dietary and behavioral assessments in an existing clinical trial to analyze the relationship of dTFA to aggression. Of 1,018 broadly sampled baseline subjects, the 945 adult men and women who brought a completed dietary survey to their baseline visit are the target of this analysis. Subjects",
    "A prospective study of intake of trans-fatty acids from ruminant fat, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, and marine oils and mortality from CVD.\tTrans-fatty acids (TFA) have adverse effects on blood lipids, but whether TFA from different sources are associated with risk of CVD remains unresolved. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between TFA intake from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO), partially hydrogenated fish oils (PHFO) and ruminant fat (rTFA) and risks of death of CVD, CHD, cerebrovascular diseases and sudden death in the Norwegian Counties Study, a population-based cohort study. Between 1974 and 1988, participants were examined",
    "A prospective study of prepregnancy dietary fat intake and risk of gestational diabetes\tBackground: Fatty acids play a vital role in glucose homeostasis; however, studies on habitual dietary fat intakes and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk are limited and provide conflicting findings. Objective: We determined whether the total amount and the type and source of prepregnancy dietary fats are related to risk of GDM. Design: A prospective study was conducted in 13,475 women who reported a singleton pregnancy between 1991 and 2001 in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II. In these women, 860 incident GDM cases were reported. The adjusted RR of GDM was estimated for quintiles of total fat, specific fat, and",
    "Essentials of Healthy Eating: A Guide\tEnough solid evidence now exists to offer women several fundamental strategies for healthy eating. They include emphasizing healthful unsaturated fats, whole grains, good protein \u201cpackages,\u201d and fruits and vegetables; limiting consumption of trans and saturated fats, highly refined grains, and sugary beverages; and taking a multivitamin with folic acid and extra vitamin D as a nutritional safety net. A diet based on these principles is healthy through virtually all life stages, from young adulthood through planning for pregnancy, pregnancy, and on into old age.",
    "Recommended dietary reference intakes, nutritional goals and dietary guidelines for fat and fatty acids: a systematic review.\tDietary fat and its effects on health and disease has attracted interest for research and Public Health. Since the 1980s many bodies and organizations have published recommendations regarding fat intake. In this paper different sets of recommendations are analyzed following a systematic review process to examine dietary reference intakes, nutritional goals and dietary guidelines for fat and fatty acids. A literature search was conducted in relevant literature databases along a search for suitable grey literature reports. Documents were included if they reported information on either recommended intake levels or dietary reference values or nutritional objectives or dietary guidelines regarding fat and/or fatty"
