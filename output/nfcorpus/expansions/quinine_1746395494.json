    "Quinine is a natural alkaloid compound derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. It has been used for centuries for its anti-malarial properties. Quinine works by disrupting the growth and reproduction of the malaria parasite in the body. It is often used in combination with other medications to treat malaria and has been a key tool in the fight against this deadly disease. Additionally, quinine is sometimes used to treat certain types of muscle cramps. However, it is important to use quinine under medical supervision, as it can cause side effects and interact with other medications.",
    "Quinine is a natural compound that is commonly used to treat malaria. It is derived from the bark of the cinchona tree and has been used for centuries due to its anti-malarial properties. Quinine works by interfering with the replication process of the malaria parasite in the body, ultimately helping to combat the infection. In addition to its medicinal uses, quinine is also used in some beverages, such as tonic water, for its distinctive bitter taste. Overall, quinine plays a crucial role in the treatment and prevention of malaria, making it an important tool in the fight against this deadly disease."

    "Genetic Analysis of Chemosensory Traits in Human Twins\tWe explored genetic influences on the perception of taste and smell stimuli. Adult twins rated the chemosensory aspects of water, sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, ethanol, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, cinnamon, androstenone, Galaxolide\u2122, cilantro, and basil. For most traits, individual differences were stable over time and some traits were heritable (h2 from 0.41 to 0.71). Subjects were genotyped for 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms within and near genes related to taste and smell. The results of these association analyses confirmed previous genotype\u2013phenotype results for PTC, quinine, and androstenone.",
    "Antidiabetic drugs used in Europe prior to the discovery of insulin.\tMany therapeutic agents had been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus before insulin was discovered and several hundred plants have shown some extent of antidiabetic activity. This study tries to explore which agents were most widely used in Europe in the pre-insulin era. According to the scientific literature and the proprietary drug industry around 1900, more than 100 agents were considered to have hypoglycemic activity. Most of them seem to have been used only occasionally while some others were recommended and marketed to a large extent. Among the medicinal plants, Syzygium cumini (syn. S. jambolanum, Eugenia jambolana), Vaccinum myrtillus and Phaseolus"
