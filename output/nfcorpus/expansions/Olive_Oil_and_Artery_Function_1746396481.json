    "The consumption of olive oil has been widely studied in relation to its effects on artery function. Olive oil is known for its high content of monounsaturated fats, which are considered heart-healthy fats. Studies have suggested that incorporating olive oil into the diet may have positive effects on artery function by reducing inflammation and improving the flexibility of blood vessels.\n\nSpecifically, olive oil is rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E and polyphenols, which are believed to help combat oxidative stress and reduce the risk of damage to the arteries. Additionally, olive oil has been shown to decrease levels of LDL cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol) while increasing levels of HDL cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol), which can improve overall heart health and artery function.\n\nIncorporating olive oil into a balanced diet along with other heart-healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins may help support healthy arteries and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is important to consume olive oil in moderation, as it is still a calorie-dense food that can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess. As always, it is best to consult with a healthcare provider or nutritionist for personalized dietary recommendations.",
    "Recent studies have explored the potential benefits of olive oil on artery function. Olive oil is a staple of the Mediterranean diet, which is known for its heart-healthy properties. Research suggests that olive oil, particularly extra virgin olive oil, may help to improve artery function by reducing inflammation and promoting the production of nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax and dilate. These effects can lead to better blood flow and lower blood pressure, both of which are crucial for cardiovascular health. Additionally, the high concentration of monounsaturated fats in olive oil is thought to play a role in its positive impact on artery function. Incorporating olive oil into a balanced diet may offer significant benefits for heart health and overall well-being."

    "Olive Oil and Artery Function, The Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, pasta, fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine, is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that a Mediterranean diet, which substituted omega-3-fatty-acid-enriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega-9 fatty-acid-rich olive oil, reduced cardiovascular events. We sought to investigate whether the addition of walnuts or olive oil to a fatty meal have differential effects on postprandial vasoactivity, lipoproteins, markers of oxidation and endothelial activation, and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Compared with a Mediterranean diet, a walnut diet has been shown to improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients. Olive oil polyphenols have been associated with several cardiovascular health benefits. Polyphenol-rich olive oil decreased blood pressure and improved endothelial function in young women with mild hypertension. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the phenolic content of virgin olive oil on endothelial reactivity. Phenolic content of olive oil improves ischemic reactive hyperemia in hypercholesterolemic patients. There are firm evidence supporting the beneficial effects of olive oil, the most genuine component of the Mediterranean diet. The roles of minor components of olive oil in the modulation of endothelial function are less investigated.",

    "The postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function.\tOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function, which may be an atherogenic factor. BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, pasta, fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine, is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that a Mediterranean diet, which substituted omega-3-fatty-acid-enriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega-9 fatty-acid-rich olive oil, reduced cardiovascular events. METHODS: We fed 10 healthy, normolipidemic subjects five meals containing 900 kcal and 50 g fat",
    "Acute effects of high-fat meals enriched with walnuts or olive oil on postprandial endothelial function.\tOBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether the addition of walnuts or olive oil to a fatty meal have differential effects on postprandial vasoactivity, lipoproteins, markers of oxidation and endothelial activation, and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). BACKGROUND: Compared with a Mediterranean diet, a walnut diet has been shown to improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients. We hypothesized that walnuts would reverse postprandial endothelial dysfunction associated with consumption of a fatty meal. METHODS: We randomized in a crossover design 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with hypercholesterolemia to 2 high-fat meal sequences to which 25 g olive",

    "Olive, soybean and palm oils intake have a similar acute detrimental effect over the endothelial function in healthy young subjects.\tBACKGROUND AND AIM: Currently, more than 30% of the caloric intake in the Colombian population comes from vegetable oil consumption mainly by the ingestion of deep-fried foods. Recently, it has been reported that unsaturated fatty acid rich oils have a beneficial effect on the endothelial function. Nevertheless, it is well know that the deep-frying process alters the chemical composition of vegetable oils and can produce adverse effects in the endothelial function. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effect of the ingestion of large amounts of olive, soybean and palm oils, fresh",
    "Phenolic content of virgin olive oil improves ischemic reactive hyperemia in hypercholesterolemic patients.\tOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the phenolic content of virgin olive oil on endothelial reactivity. BACKGROUND: Endothelial-dependent vasodilatation is impaired during the postprandial state, and oxidative stress could play a key role in its development. METHODS: Twenty-one hypercholesterolemic volunteers received two breakfasts, using a randomized sequential crossover design. Both arms received the same olive oil, but one had its phenolic acid content reduced from 400 to 80 ppm. Ischemic reactive hyperemia (IRH) was measured with a laser-Doppler procedure at baseline and 2 h and 4 h after oil",
    "The role of virgin olive oil components in the modulation of endothelial function.\tThe endothelium is involved in many of the processes related to the development of atherosclerosis, which is considered an inflammatory disease. Actually, traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis predispose to endothelial dysfunction, which is manifested as an increase in the expression of specific cytokines and adhesion molecules. There are firm evidence supporting the beneficial effects of olive oil, the most genuine component of the Mediterranean diet. Although the effects of olive oil and other oleic acid-rich dietary oils on atherosclerosis and plasma lipids are well known, the roles of minor components have been less investigated. Minor components constitute only 1-2%",
    "Olive oil intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the PREDIMED Study\tBackground It is unknown whether individuals at high cardiovascular risk sustain a benefit in cardiovascular disease from increased olive oil consumption. The aim was to assess the association between total olive oil intake, its varieties (extra virgin and common olive oil) and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Methods We included 7,216 men and women at high cardiovascular risk, aged 55 to 80 years, from the PREvenci\u00f3n con DIeta MEDiterr\u00e1nea (PREDIMED) study, a multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
