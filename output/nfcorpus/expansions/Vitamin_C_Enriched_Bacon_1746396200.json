The author reviews the ability of vitamins C and E to inhibit NNC formation in chemical systems, in nitrite-preserved meat, in experimental animals and in humans. Dietary vitamins C and E both produced 30% to 60% inhibitions in most carcinogenesis experiments employing preformed carcinogens.

    "Airborne mutagens produced by frying beef, pork and a soy-based food.\tAirborne cooking by-products from frying beef (hamburgers), pork (bacon strips) and soybean-based food (tempeh burgers) were collected, extracted, tested for mutagenicity and chemically analysed. The fumes generated by frying pork and beef were mutagenic, with 4900 and 1300 revertants/g of food cooked, respectively. No mutagenicity was detected in fumes from frying tempeh burgers. Bacon fried to a well-done but non-charred state was eight times more mutagenic in a microsuspension Ames/Salmonella test (TA98 with S-9) than hamburgers and about 350 times more mutagenic than tempeh",
    "Survey of naturally and conventionally cured commercial frankfurters, ham, and bacon for physio-chemical characteristics that affect bacterial growth.\tNatural and organic food regulations preclude the use of sodium nitrite/nitrate and other antimicrobials for processed meat products. Consequently, processors have begun to use natural nitrate/nitrite sources, such as celery juice/powder, sea salt, and turbinado sugar, to manufacture natural and organic products with cured meat characteristics but without sodium nitrite. The objective of this study was to compare physio-chemical characteristics that affect Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes growth in naturally cured and traditionally cured commercial frankfurters, hams, and bacon. Correlations of specific product characteristics to pathogen",
    "Cured and broiled meat consumption in relation to childhood cancer: Denver, Colorado (United States)\tThe association between cured and broiled meat consumption by the mother during pregnancy and by the child was examined in relation to childhood cancer. Five meat groups (ham, bacon, or sausage; hot dogs; hamburgers; bologna, pastrami, corned beef, salami, or lunch meat; charcoal broiled foods) were assessed. Exposures among 234 cancer cases (including 56 acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 45 brain tumor) and 206 controls selected by random-digit dialing in the Denver, Colorado (United States) standard metropolitan statistical area were compared, with adjustment for confounders",
    "Effects of dietary proteins on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal subjects: interaction with dietary cholesterol.\tWe have compared the effects of dietary soy protein and casein in diets low in cholesterol (less than 100 mg/d) and in diets enriched in cholesterol (500 mg/d) to examine whether the level of cholesterol intake affects the response of plasma lipoproteins to dietary proteins of plant and animal origin. Normal men and women consumed formula diets containing 20% of calories as soy protein or casein, 27% as fat and 53% as carbohydrate in 2 crossover studies. The dietary periods lasted for 31 days and were separated by a month-long interim period on self",
    "Dietary lipids modulate methylmercury toxicity in Atlantic salmon.\tThis experiment aimed to study the molecular toxicity of methylmercury (MeHg) in liver, brain and white muscle of Atlantic salmon fed a diet based on fish oil (FO, high dietary n-3/n-6 ratio) compared to an alternative diet mainly based on vegetable oil (VO, low dietary n-3/n-6 ratio). Juvenile salmon were fed decontaminated diets or the FO and VO diets enriched with 5 mg Hg/kg (added as MeHg) for three months. The dietary lipid composition affected the fatty acid composition in the tissues, especially in liver and white muscle. After 84 days of exposure, the liver accumulated",
    "Meat intake and bladder cancer risk in 2 prospective cohort studies.\tBACKGROUND: Nitrosamines, which are known bladder carcinogens, or their precursors are found in certain meat items, and concentrations of these compounds are especially high in bacon. Only 3 cohort studies, all with <100 case subjects, have examined the relation between meat intake and bladder cancer, and few studies have examined the relation of different meat types with bladder cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the association between specific meat items and bladder cancer in 2 large prospective studies. DESIGN: We analyzed data from 2 cohorts with up to 22 y of follow-up and 808 incident bladder cancer cases.",
    "Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability.\tThe usual dietary sources of vitamin B(12) are animal foods, meat, milk, egg, fish, and shellfish. As the intrinsic factor-mediated intestinal absorption system is estimated to be saturated at about 1.5-2.0 microg per meal under physiologic conditions, vitamin B(12) bioavailability significantly decreases with increasing intake of vitamin B(12) per meal. The bioavailability of vitamin B(12) in healthy humans from fish meat, sheep meat, and chicken meat averaged 42%, 56%-89%, and 61%-66%, respectively. Vitamin B(12) in eggs seems to be poorly absorbed (< 9%) relative to other animal food products. In the",
    "The postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function.\tOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the postprandial effect of components of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function, which may be an atherogenic factor. BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet, containing olive oil, pasta, fruits, vegetables, fish, and wine, is associated with an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that a Mediterranean diet, which substituted omega-3-fatty-acid-enriched canola oil for the traditionally consumed omega-9 fatty-acid-rich olive oil, reduced cardiovascular events. METHODS: We fed 10 healthy, normolipidemic subjects five meals containing 900 kcal and 50 g fat",
    "Hazelnut-enriched diet improves cardiovascular risk biomarkers beyond a lipid-lowering effect in hypercholesterolemic subjects.\tBACKGROUND: Tree nuts, particularly almonds, walnuts, and pistachios, have been shown to possess cardioprotective effects. However, there is little information on the effects of hazelnut consumption on cardiovascular risk markers. METHODS: The antiatherogenic effect of hazelnut before and after consumption in hypercholesterolemic subjects was investigated. Twenty-one hypercholesterolemic volunteers (18 men and 3 women) were recruited in a double control sandwich model intervention study with a single group and three isoenergetic diet periods. These were control diet I (4 weeks), hazelnut-enriched diet (4 weeks; hazelnut contributing 18%-20%",
    "Effects of vitamins C and E on N-nitroso compound formation, carcinogenesis, and cancer.\tThe properties of N-nitroso compounds (NNC) and of vitamins C and E are briefly described. The author reviews the ability of vitamins C and E to inhibit NNC formation in chemical systems, in nitrite-preserved meat, in experimental animals and in humans. Dietary vitamins C and E both produced 30% to 60% inhibitions in most carcinogenesis experiments employing preformed carcinogens. Vitamin C reversed transformation in an in vitro system. Carcinogenicity tests of the vitamins are reviewed (vitamin C can promote bladder carcinogenesis). Intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (which contain vitamin C"
