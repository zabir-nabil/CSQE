    "When considering which vitamin supplements are worth taking, it is important to first consult with a healthcare provider to determine your individual needs. While a balanced diet should ideally provide all the necessary nutrients, some individuals may benefit from supplementing certain vitamins to address deficiencies or specific health concerns. Common supplements that are often recommended include vitamin D for bone health and immunity, omega-3 fatty acids for heart health, and vitamin B12 for energy production. However, it is essential to be cautious with supplement intake, as excessive amounts can have adverse effects. Ultimately, the decision to take vitamin supplements should be based on personalized recommendations from a healthcare professional.",
    "When it comes to vitamin supplements worth taking, it's important to consider individual needs and deficiencies. While a balanced diet should ideally provide all the nutrients our bodies require, sometimes supplements can help fill the gaps. Some common vitamin supplements that are often considered beneficial include Vitamin D, particularly for those who have limited sun exposure, Vitamin B12 for vegetarians and vegans who may be deficient in this nutrient, and Omega-3 fatty acids for heart health.\n\nIt's always best to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure that you are addressing specific deficiencies or health concerns effectively. Remember, supplements should complement a healthy diet and lifestyle, not replace it."

    "Vitamin Supplements Worth Taking Taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Many patients treated for vitamin D deficiency fail to achieve an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] despite high doses of ergo- or cholecalciferol. Many vegans take B-12 supplements irregularly or refuse to adopt them at all, considering them to be 'unnatural' products. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the long-term effect of a vegan diet on serum B-12 concentrations in healthy omnivore adults. We note that many of our patients who have developed symptomatic hypercalcemia were taking vitamin D, calcium, or shark cartilage supplements. We report eight cases of hypercalcemia in cancer patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in whom these nutritional supplements may have contributed to the prevalence or severity of hypercalcemia. Vitamin and mineral supplements are commonly used to prevent chronic diseases. To systematically review evidence for the benefit and harms of vitamin and mineral supplements in community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. For many years, the prevailing concept was that LDL oxidation plays the central role in atherogenesis. Unfortunately, major randomized clinical trials yielded disappointing results and recent meta-analyses concluded that indiscriminate, high dose vitamin E supplementation results in increased mortality.",

    "Taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\tMany patients treated for vitamin D deficiency fail to achieve an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] despite high doses of ergo- or cholecalciferol. The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day would improve absorption and increase serum levels of 25(OH)D. This was a prospective cohort study in an ambulatory tertiary-care referral center. Patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Bone Clinic for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency who were not responding to treatment make up the study group. Subjects were instructed to",
    "The impact of vegan diet on B-12 status in healthy omnivores: five-year prospective study.\tBACKGROUND: There are no long-term prospective studies assessing the impact of the vegan diet on vitamin B-12 (B-12) status. Many vegans take B-12 supplements irregularly or refuse to adopt them at all, considering them to be \"unnatural\" products. The use of B-12 fortified food may be an alternative. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the long-term effect of a vegan diet on serum B-12 concentrations in healthy omnivore adults, comparing the influence of natural products consumption and B-12 fortified food. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A five year prospective study was carried out comprising 20",
    "Dangerous nutrition? Calcium, vitamin D, and shark cartilage nutritional supplements and cancer-related hypercalcemia.\tThe use of nutritional supplements in the general population and in cancer patients has become very popular. These supplements are not perceived as medications and are presumed to be safe by cancer patients, who may however be at risk for hypercalcemia. We note that many of our patients who have developed symptomatic hypercalcemia were taking vitamin D, calcium, or shark cartilage supplements. We report eight cases of hypercalcemia in cancer patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in whom these nutritional supplements may have contributed to the prevalence or severity of hypercalcemia.",

    "Creatine: are the benefits worth the risk?\tCreatine monohydrate is a popular sports supplement used to maintain levels of high-energy phosphates during exercise. As a supplement, varying amounts are consumed per person corresponding to parameters such as body mass and level of training (i.e. maintenance versus loading doses). Numerous studies have reported beneficial effects including increased muscle mass during training and neural protection. However, negative reports have also been made of possible side effects, such as muscle cramping during exercise, and potential impurities. The present paper introduces the positive and negative aspects of creatine supplementation and focuses on the toxicological data of creatine, its metabolites and associated mutagenicity or carcinogenicity, genomeceutical",
    "Endurance exercise results in DNA damage as detected by the comet assay.\tTo determine if 6 weeks of supplementation with antioxidants could alleviate exercise-induced DNA damage, we studied 21 runners during a 50 km ultramarathon. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) placebos (PL) or (2) antioxidants (AO) (1000 mg vitamin C and 400 IU RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate). The comet assay was used to assess DNA damage in circulating leukocytes at selected time points: pre-, mid-, and 2 h postrace and daily for 6 days postrace. All subjects completed the race: run time 7.1 +/- 0.1 h,",
    "Who uses multivitamins? A cross-sectional study in the Physicians' Health Study.\tPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported multivitamin use in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) cohort and its association with various lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors to improve our understanding of who tends to use multivitamins. METHODS: Among 18,040 middle-aged and older men, information on lifestyle and clinical factors was collected from a baseline enrollment questionnaire, and supplement use and dietary factors were assessed through a food-frequency questionnaire. Four categories of multivitamin use were considered: (1) no supplement use, (2) use of",
    "Gerson regimen.\tThe Gerson regimen, developed by Max Gerson in the 1930s, is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. It involves consuming fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices, eliminating salt from the diet, taking supplements such as potassium, vitamin B12, thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes, and detoxifying liver with coffee enemas to stimulate metabolism. Gerson therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and processed food, which changes its sodium and potassium content. It emphasizes increasing potassium intake and minimizing sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver. The coffee enemas are",
    "Antioxidant status and its association with elevated depressive symptoms among US adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2005\u201306\tWe examined the relationship of elevated depressive symptoms with antioxidant status. Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2005\u201306 on US adults aged 20\u201385 years were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire with a score cutpoint of 10 to define \u201celevated depressive symptoms\u201d. Serum antioxidant status was measured by serum levels of carotenoids, retinol (free and retinyl esters), vitamin C and vitamin E. The main analyses consisted of multiple logistic and zero-inflated poisson regression models, taking into account sampling design complexity. The final sample consisted",
    "No evidence supports vitamin E indiscriminate supplementation.\tFor many years, the prevailing concept was that LDL oxidation plays the central role in atherogenesis. As a consequence, supplementation of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, became very popular. Unfortunately, major randomized clinical trials yielded disappointing results and recent meta-analyses concluded that indiscriminate, high dose vitamin E supplementation results in increased mortality. This conclusion raised (quite reasonable) criticism, much of which referred to the characteristics of meta-analysis. In our recent study, we used a Markov-model approach, which is free of most of the limitations of meta-analyses. Our major finding was that the average quality-adjusted"
