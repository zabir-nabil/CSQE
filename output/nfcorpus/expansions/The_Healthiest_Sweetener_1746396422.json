    "When it comes to selecting the healthiest sweetener, it is essential to consider factors such as nutritional content, caloric value, and potential impact on blood sugar levels. While various sweeteners are available on the market, some are considered healthier options than others. \n\nOne of the top contenders for the healthiest sweetener is stevia. Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant. It is considered a non-caloric sweetener, making it a popular choice for those looking to reduce their sugar intake and calorie consumption. Stevia also has a minimal impact on blood sugar levels, making it a suitable option for individuals with diabetes or those aiming to manage their blood glucose levels.\n\nAnother healthy sweetener option is raw honey. Raw honey is a natural sweetener that contains antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It possesses antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a healthier alternative to refined sugar. However, it is important to consume raw honey in moderation due to its high sugar content.\n\nWhen choosing a sweetener, it is crucial to opt for natural options like stevia and raw honey rather than artificial sweeteners that may have potential health risks. Additionally, moderation is key when consuming any sweetener, as excessive intake of even the healthiest sweeteners can have negative consequences on our health. Ultimately, the healthiest sweetener for you will depend on your individual health goals and dietary needs.",
    "When it comes to choosing the healthiest sweetener, there are several factors to consider. Natural sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, and molasses contain some beneficial nutrients like antioxidants and minerals, making them a better option than refined sugars. These natural sweeteners also have a lower glycemic index, which means they have a slower effect on blood sugar levels compared to white sugar.\n\nStevia is another popular sweetener that is derived from the leaves of the stevia plant. It is much sweeter than sugar but has zero calories and no effect on blood sugar levels, making it a great choice for those looking to reduce their sugar intake.\n\nUltimately, the healthiest sweetener will depend on individual needs and preferences. It's important to consume sweeteners in moderation and be mindful of the overall balance of your diet. Consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist can help you make the best choice for your health goals."

    "Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) a bio-sweetener: a review.\tStudies revealed that Stevia has been used throughout the world since ancient times for various purposes; for example, as a sweetener and a medicine. We conducted a systematic literature review to summarize and quantify the past and current evidence for Stevia. We searched relevant papers up to 2007 in various databases. As we know that the leaves of Stevia plants have functional and sensory properties superior to those of many other high-potency sweeteners, Stevia is likely to become a major source of high-potency sweetener for the growing natural food market in the future. Although Stevia can be helpful to anyone, there are",
    "The potential toxicity of artificial sweeteners.\tSince their discovery, the safety of artificial sweeteners has been controversial. Artificial sweeteners provide the sweetness of sugar without the calories. As public health attention has turned to reversing the obesity epidemic in the United States, more individuals of all ages are choosing to use these products. These choices may be beneficial for those who cannot tolerate sugar in their diets (e.g., diabetics). However, scientists disagree about the relationships between sweeteners and lymphomas, leukemias, cancers of the bladder and brain, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, and systemic lupus. Recently these substances have received",
    "Sweetened Beverages, Coffee, and Tea and Depression Risk among Older US Adults\tSweetened beverages, coffee, and tea are the most consumed non-alcoholic beverages and may have important health consequences. We prospectively evaluated the consumption of various types of beverages assessed in 1995\u20131996 in relation to self-reported depression diagnosis after 2000 among 263,923 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from multivariate logistic regressions. The OR (95% CI) comparing \u22654 cans/cups per day with none were 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17\u20131.44) for soft drinks, 1.38 (1.15\u20131.65) for fruit drinks,",
    "Effects of sugar-sweetened and sugar-free cocoa on endothelial function in overweight adults.\tBACKGROUND: Studies of cocoa suggest an array of cardiovascular benefits; however, the effects of daily intake of sugar-free and sugar-sweetened cocoa beverages on endothelial function (EF) have yet to be established. METHODS: 44 adults (BMI 25-35 kg/m2) participated in a randomized, controlled, crossover trial. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence: sugar-free cocoa beverage, sugar-sweetened cocoa beverage, and sugar-sweetened cocoa-free placebo. Treatments were administered daily for 6 weeks, with a 4-week washout period.",
    "Sucrose activates human taste pathways differently from artificial sweetener.\tAnimal models suggest that sucrose activates taste afferents differently than non-caloric sweeteners. Little information exists how artificial sweeteners engage central taste pathways in the human brain. We assessed sucrose and sucralose taste pleasantness across a concentration gradient in 12 healthy control women and applied 10% sucrose and matched sucralose during functional magnet resonance imaging. The results indicate that (1) both sucrose and sucralose activate functionally connected primary taste pathways; (2) taste pleasantness predicts left insula response; (3) sucrose elicits a stronger brain response in the anterior insula, frontal operculum, striatum and anterior cingulate, compared to sucralose; (4)",
    "Sugar substitutes: Health controversy over perceived benefits\tSugar is an inseparable part of the food we consume. But too much sugar is not ideal for our teeth and waistline. There have been some controversial suggestions that excessive sugar may play an important role in certain degenerative diseases. So artificial sweeteners or artificially sweetened products continue to attract consumers. A sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. Some kind of health related side effects including carcinogenicity are",
    "Who benefits most from the cardioprotective properties of alcohol consumption--health freaks or couch potatoes?\tBACKGROUND: The cardioprotective properties of moderate alcohol consumption, compared with abstinence or heavy drinking, are widely reported, but whether the benefits are experienced equally by all moderate drinkers is less well known. AIMS: To examine the association between average alcohol intake per week and the incidence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction during 17 years of follow-up for 9655 men and women without prevalent disease in the general population; and to test whether the level of cardioprotection differs according to subjects' other health behaviours (healthy, moderately healthy, unhealthy) at entry to the study.",

The health concerns that have been raised about the amounts of sugar that are in the current diet, primarily as beverages, are the subject of this review. Just less than 50% of the added sugars (sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) are found in soft drinks and fruit drinks. The intake of soft drinks has increased 5-fold between 1950 and 2000. Most meta-analyses have shown that the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,",
    "Total antioxidant content of alternatives to refined sugar.\tBACKGROUND: Oxidative damage is implicated in the etiology of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other degenerative disorders. Recent nutritional research has focused on the antioxidant potential of foods, while current dietary recommendations are to increase the intake of antioxidant-rich foods rather than supplement specific nutrients. Many alternatives to refined sugar are available, including raw cane sugar, plant saps/syrups (eg, maple syrup, agave nectar), molasses, honey, and fruit sugars (eg, date sugar). Unrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants, similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain products. OBJECTIVE: To"
