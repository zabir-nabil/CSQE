    "Vitamin K is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in blood clotting and maintaining strong bones. There are two main forms of vitamin K - K1, which is found in green leafy vegetables, and K2, which is synthesized by bacteria in our gut and can also be found in fermented foods. Vitamin K is necessary for the production of proteins that regulate blood clotting, preventing excessive bleeding. Additionally, it helps to ensure calcium is properly deposited in our bones, promoting bone health and reducing the risk of fractures. Including sources of vitamin K in your diet such as spinach, kale, broccoli, and fermented foods can help ensure you are meeting your body's needs for this important nutrient.",
    "Vitamin K is an essential nutrient that plays a key role in blood clotting and bone health. There are two main forms of vitamin K: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), which is found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), which is found in fermented foods like cheese and natto. Vitamin K works by activating proteins that help with blood clotting, which is crucial for preventing excessive bleeding. In addition, vitamin K is also important for bone health as it helps in the regulation of calcium in the body. Adequate intake of vitamin K through a balanced diet is essential for maintaining optimal health and wellbeing."

    "vitamin K We report on the case of an infant who was hospitalized because of failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, and delayed psychomotor development. Investigations showed vitamin B(12) deficiency with hematocytopenia and pervasive developmental disorders as well as vitamin K and vitamin D deficiencies. The infant's mother presented the same deficiencies. BACKGROUND: Vitamin and mineral supplements are commonly used to prevent chronic diseases. PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence for the benefit and harms of vitamin and mineral supplements in community-dwelling, nutrient-sufficient adults for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Epidemiological studies examining potential associations between dried fruit consumption, diet quality, and weight status are lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the association of dried fruit consumption with nutrient intake, diet quality, and anthropometric indicators of overweight/obesity.",

    "gamma-Irradiation dose: effects on baby-leaf spinach ascorbic acid, carotenoids, folate, alpha-tocopherol, and phylloquinone concentrations.\tIonizing radiation of fruits and vegetables, in the form of gamma rays or electron beams, is effective in overcoming quarantine barriers in trade and prolonging shelf life, but a void of information persists on ionizing radiation effects of vitamin profiles in individual foods. Baby-leaf spinach from commercial cultivars, flat-leafed 'Lazio' and crinkled-leaf 'Samish', was grown, harvested, and surface sanitized according to industry practices. Baby-leaf spinach of each cultivar was packaged under air or N(2) atmosphere, representing industry practices",
    "[Consequences of exclusive breast-feeding in vegan mother newborn--case report].\tWe report on the case of an infant who was hospitalized because of failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, and delayed psychomotor development. He was 10 months old and had been exclusively breast-fed by his vegan mother. Investigations showed vitamin B(12) deficiency with hematocytopenia and pervasive developmental disorders as well as vitamin K and vitamin D deficiencies. The infant's mother presented the same deficiencies. Introduction of vitamin supplementation normalized the biological disorders, and the infant showed weight gain and neurological improvement. This case highlights that a vegan diet during pregnancy followed by exclusive breast-feeding can induce nutritional deficiencies",
    "Safety considerations and potential interactions of vitamins: should vitamins be considered drugs?\tOBJECTIVE: To examine adverse effects, adverse events, and potential interactions of vitamins in light of their current prevalence of use, and to discuss whether vitamins should be considered over-the-counter drugs or natural health products/dietary supplements. DATA SOURCES: We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search, explored 4 online databases (Medline Plus, Drug Digest, Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database, and the database of the University of Maryland), and examined reference lists of included studies published from 1966 through October 2009. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The studies were reviewed, with an emphasis on randomized",

    "Nutritional quality and health benefits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.): a review.\tChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important pulse crop grown and consumed all over the world, especially in the Afro-Asian countries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, and protein quality is considered to be better than other pulses. Chickpea has significant amounts of all the essential amino acids except sulphur-containing amino acids, which can be complemented by adding cereals to the daily diet. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fibre, oligosaccharides and simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Although lipids are present in low amounts, chickpea is rich in nutritionally",
    "Changes in nutrient intake and dietary quality among participants with type 2 diabetes following a low-fat vegan diet or a conventional diabetes di...\tBACKGROUND: Although vegan diets improve diabetes management, little is known about the nutrient profiles or diet quality of individuals with type 2 diabetes who adopt a vegan diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess the changes in nutrient intake and dietary quality among participants following a low-fat vegan diet or the 2003 American Diabetes Association dietary recommendations. DESIGN: A 22-week randomized, controlled clinical trial examining changes in nutrient intake and diet quality. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Participants with type 2 diabetes (n=99) in a free-living setting.

    "Flavonoid permeability across an in situ model of the blood-brain barrier.\tUnderstanding mechanisms associated with flavonoid neuroprotection is complicated by the lack of information on their ability to enter the CNS. This study examined naringenin and quercetin permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), using in vitro (ECV304/C6 coculture) and in situ (rat) models. We report measurable permeabilities (P(app)) for both flavonoids across the in vitro BBB model, consistent with their lipophilicity. Both flavonoids showed measurable in situ BBB permeability. The rates of uptake (K(in)) into the right cerebral hemisphere were 0.145 and 0.019 ml min(-1) g(-1) for naringenin and quercetin",
    "Tea catechins' affinity for human cannabinoid receptors.\tAmong the many known health benefits of tea catechins count anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, as well as effects on the regulation of food intake. Here we address cannabimimetic bioactivity of catechin derivatives occurring in tea leaves as a possible cellular effector of these functionalities. Competitive radioligand binding assays using recombinant human cannabinoid receptors expressed in Chem-1 and CHO cells identified (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, EGCG (K(i)=33.6 microM), (-)-epigallocatechin, EGC (K(i)=35.7 microM), and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, ECG (K(i)=47.3 microM) as ligands with moderate affinity for type 1 cannabinoid receptors, CB1. Binding to CB2 was weaker",
    "Dried fruit consumption is associated with improved diet quality and reduced obesity in US adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey...\tEpidemiological studies examining potential associations between dried fruit consumption, diet quality, and weight status are lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the association of dried fruit consumption with nutrient intake, diet quality, and anthropometric indicators of overweight/obesity. A secondary analysis of dietary and anthropometric data collected from adult (19+ years) participants (n = 13\u00a0292) of the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was conducted. Dried fruit consumers were defined as those consuming amounts \u215b cup-equivalent fruit per day or more",
