    "Infectobesity refers to the potential link between viral infections and obesity in individuals. One virus that has gained attention in this area is Adenovirus 36. Studies suggest that infection with Adenovirus 36 may increase the risk of childhood obesity. Research has shown that individuals with higher levels of antibodies to Adenovirus 36 tend to have higher body mass index (BMI) measurements, indicating a possible association between the virus and weight gain. This connection has raised concerns about the role of viral infections in the development of obesity, particularly in children. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of Adenovirus 36 and other viruses on obesity and to explore potential preventive and therapeutic strategies to address infectobesity.",
    "Infectobesity, a term used to describe the potential link between infections and obesity, has gained attention in recent years. One such infectious agent under scrutiny is Adenovirus 36 (Ad-36), which has been suggested to play a role in childhood obesity. Studies have shown that exposure to Ad-36 may lead to an increase in fat accumulation in the body, particularly in children.\n\nThe mechanism behind how Ad-36 contributes to obesity is still being investigated. It is believed that the virus has the ability to promote the differentiation of stem cells into fat cells, leading to an increase in adipose tissue. Additionally, Ad-36 may also alter metabolic processes in the body, making it easier for individuals to gain weight.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all individuals exposed to Ad-36 will develop obesity. Genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and other environmental influences also play a significant role in the development of obesity. More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between Ad-36 infection and childhood obesity, as well as to explore potential preventative and treatment strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, Infectobesity, particularly in the context of Adenovirus 36 and childhood obesity, presents a complex and evolving area of study. Continued research in this field may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of obesity and help inform public health interventions to address this pressing issue."

    "Human adenovirus-36 and childhood obesity.\tThere is increasing evidence that obesity in humans is associated with infection with human adenovirus-36 (Adv36). Infection of experimental animals with Adv36 demonstrates that this virus causes obesity. Human studies have shown a prevalence of Adv36 infection of 30% or greater in obese adult humans, but a correlation with obesity has not always been demonstrated. In contrast, three published studies and one presented study with a total of 559 children all show that there is an increase in prevalence of Adv36 infection in obese children (28%) compared to non-obese children (10%). The explanation for the apparently more robust correlation of Adv36 infection with obesity",
    "Human adenovirus-36 antibody status is associated with obesity in children.\tBACKGROUND: Human adenovirus-36 (Ad-36) is thought to induce obesity by a direct effect of the viral E4orf1 gene on lipogenic enzymes in host adipocytes. Ad-36 prevalence is 30% in obese adults, but prevalence has not been reported in childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Ad-36 infection in obese Korean children (age 14.8 +/- 1.9; range 8.3-6.3 years); correlation of infection with BMI z-score and other obesity measures. METHODS: Blood was drawn at the annual school physical exam or clinic visit; Ad-36 status was determined by serum neutralization assay; and routine serum chemistry values",
    "Adenovirus 36 infection and obesity.\tThe most important factors leading to fat accumulation in children are genetic inheritance, endocrine alterations, and behavioural/environmental causes. In addition, experimental animal studies have shown that infections due to various pathogens can lead to overweight and obesity conditions, and studies of humans have found that the incidence of seroconversion against some of these may be significantly more frequent in obese adults and children than in normal subjects. However, the results of these studies are not conclusive and, in some cases, have raised more questions than answers. We reviewed the literature concerning the role of adenovirus 36 (AD-36), the most widely studied infectious agent in animals and",
    "A framework for identification of infections that contribute to human obesity.\tWHO has declared obesity to be a global epidemic. Obesity management strategies mainly target behavioural components of the disorder, but are only marginally effective. A comprehensive understanding of the causative factors of obesity might provide more effective management approaches. Several microbes are causatively and correlatively linked with obesity in animals and human beings. If infections contribute to human obesity, then entirely different prevention and treatment strategies and public health policies could be needed to address this subtype of the disorder. Ethical reasons preclude experimental infection of human beings with candidate microbes to unequivocally determine their contribution to obesity. As an alternative, the available information about the",
    "Adipogenic Human Adenovirus Ad-36 Induces Commitment, Differentiation, and Lipid Accumulation in Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells\tHuman adenovirus Ad-36 is causatively and correlatively linked with animal and human obesity, respectively. Ad-36 enhances differentiation of rodent preadipocytes, but its effect on adipogenesis in humans is unknown. To indirectly assess the role of Ad-36-induced adipogenesis in human obesity, the effect of the virus on commitment, differentiation, and lipid accumulation was investigated in vitro in primary human adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (hASC). Ad-36 infected hASC in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Even in the presence of osteogenic media, Ad-36-infected hASC showed significantly greater lipid accumulation,",
    "Adenovirus-36 Is Associated with Obesity in Children and Adults in Sweden as Determined by Rapid ELISA\tBackground Experimental and natural human adenovirus-36 (Adv36) infection of multiple animal species results in obesity through increasing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Presence of Adv36 antibodies detected by serum neutralization assay has previously been associated with obesity in children and adults living in the USA, South Korea and Italy, whereas no association with adult obesity was detected in Belgium/the Netherlands nor among USA military personnel. Adv36 infection has also been shown to reduce blood lipid levels, increase glucose uptake by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies, and to associate with improved glycemic control in non-diabetic individuals. Principal",
    "Association of Adenovirus 36 Infection with Obesity and Metabolic Markers in Humans: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies\tBackground Several studies have shown that Adenovirus 36 (Ad36) influences the risk of obesity in humans. Clarifying the relationship between Ad36 infection and obesity could lead to more effective approaches for the management of obesity. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to confirm the influence of Ad36 infection on obesity and metabolic markers. Methodology/Principal Findings We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for pertinent articles (including their references) published between 1951 and April 22, 2012. Only English language reports of original observational studies were included in this meta-analysis",
    "Infectobesity: obesity of infectious origin.\tThe rapid increase in obesity and the associated health care costs have prompted a search for better approaches for its prevention and management. Such efforts may be facilitated by better understanding the etiology of obesity. Of the several etiological factors, infection, an unusual causative factor, has recently started receiving greater attention. In the last two decades, 10 adipogenic pathogens were reported, including human and nonhuman viruses, scrapie agents, bacteria, and gut microflora. Some of these pathogens are associated with human obesity, but their causative role in human obesity has not been established. This chapter presents information about the natural hosts, signs and symptoms, and",
    "Viral obesity: fact or fiction?\tThe aetiology of obesity is multifactorial. An understanding of the contributions of various causal factors is essential for the proper management of obesity. Although it is primarily thought of as a condition brought on by lifestyle choices, recent evidence shows there is a link between obesity and viral infections. Numerous animal models have documented an increased body weight and a number of physiologic changes, including increased insulin sensitivity, increased glucose uptake and decreased leptin secretion that contribute to an increase in body fat in adenovirus-36 infection. Other viral agents associated with increasing obesity in animals included canine distemper virus, rous-associated virus 7, scrapie, Borna disease virus, SMAM-1",
    "Transmissibility of adenovirus-induced adiposity in a chicken model.\tBACKGROUND: We previously reported that human adenovirus Ad-36 induces adiposity and paradoxically lower levels of serum cholesterol (CHOL) and triglycerides (TG) in animals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the transmissibility of Ad-36 and Ad-36 induced adiposity using a chicken model. DESIGN: Experiment 1--four chickens were housed (two per cage) and one from each cage was inoculated with Ad-36. Duration of presence of Ad-36 DNA in the blood of all chickens was monitored. Experiment 2--two groups of chickens were intranasally inoculated with Ad-36 (infected donors, I-D) or media (control donors, C-D)."
