    "Czechoslovakia was a country located in central Europe that existed from 1918 to 1992. It was formed after World War I from the territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, combining the regions of Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia, and parts of Silesia. The country had a tumultuous history, including occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II and later communist rule under the Soviet Union. In 1992, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two separate countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, due to political and economic differences. This marked the end of Czechoslovakia as a unified nation, but both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have since become independent and thriving countries in their own right.",
