    "Relieving Yourself of Excess Estrogen, Alternative and complementary therapeutic approaches, such as the use of a wide array of herbal, nutritional, and physical manipulations, are becoming popular for relieving symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). The present study evaluated the efficacy of soy protein (SP) supplementation in relieving the pain and discomfort associated with OA. Recent observed feminization of aquatic animals has raised concerns about estrogenic compounds in water supplies and the potential for these chemicals to reach drinking water. This paper reviews the literature regarding various sources of estrogens, in surface, source and drinking water, with an emphasis on the active molecule that comes from OCs. The aim of this study was to compare results obtained by eight different short-term assays of estrogen-like actions of chemicals conducted in 10 different laboratories in five countries. The test compounds were coded before distribution. Test methods included direct binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), proliferation of MCF-7 cells, transient reporter gene expression in MCF-7 cells, reporter gene expression in yeast.",

    "Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Evaluation of results using different urodynamic parameters.\tWe studied the obstruction-relieving capabilities of transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP) in 32 symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urodynamic studies with pressure-flow analysis were performed before and 6 months after treatment. All 32 patients showed significant improvement of both subjective and objective obstruction parameters. There were few postoperative irritative symptoms and one patient required recatheterization. In conclusion, TVP is a promising modification of performing transurethral resection of the prostate, and it is indeed capable of relieving bladder outflow obstruction.",

    "The impact of cow's milk-mediated mTORC1-signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer\tProstate cancer (PCa) is dependent on androgen receptor signaling and aberrations of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway mediating excessive and sustained growth signaling. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human PCas. Oncogenic mTORC1 signaling activates key subsets of mRNAs that cooperate in distinct steps of PCa initiation and progression. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of PCa. mTORC1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer.",
