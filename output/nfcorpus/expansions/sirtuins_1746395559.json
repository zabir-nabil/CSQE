    "Sirtuins are a class of proteins that are known for their role in regulating various cellular processes, including aging, metabolism, and stress response. These proteins are involved in gene expression, DNA repair, and maintaining the integrity of the cell. There are several types of sirtuins found in different organisms, with each type playing a specific role in cellular function. Research has shown that sirtuins may have potential health benefits, such as promoting longevity and protecting against age-related diseases. Scientists continue to study sirtuins to better understand their mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.",
    "Sirtuins are a family of proteins that play a key role in regulating several cellular processes, including DNA repair, metabolism, and inflammation. They are often referred to as \"longevity genes\" due to their involvement in promoting cellular health and protecting against age-related diseases. Sirtuins are known to be activated by calorie restriction and exercise, leading to enhanced cellular defense mechanisms and potentially extending lifespan. Research on sirtuins continues to uncover their significance in maintaining overall health and understanding how they can be targeted for therapeutic interventions in various conditions."

    "sirtuins Silent information regulator two proteins (sirtuins or SIRTs) are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).

A neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseases. This review aims to discuss recent advances in understanding the role of sirtuins, in particular mammalian SIRT1, in promoting longevity and its potential molecular basis for neuroprotection against cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease pathology. SIRT1 overexpression prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and increases resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors. Sirtuins (SIRTs), a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases, are emerging as key molecules that regulate aging and age-related diseases including cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. We compared the concentration of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the brains of AD patients and controls using Western immunoblots and in situ hybridization. We report a significant reduction of SIRT1 in the parietal cortex of AD patients, but not in the cerebellum.",

    "Protective effects and mechanisms of sirtuins in the nervous system\tSilent information regulator two proteins (sirtuins or SIRTs) are a group of histone deacetylases whose activities are dependent on and regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). They suppress genome-wide transcription, yet upregulate a select set of proteins related to energy metabolism and pro-survival mechanisms, and therefore play a key role in the longevity effects elicited by calorie restriction. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of sirtuins has been reported for both acute and chronic neurological diseases. The focus of this review is to summarize the latest progress regarding the protective effects of sirtuins, with a focus on SIRT1. We first introduce the distribution",
    "At the crossroad of lifespan, calorie restriction, chromatin and disease: meeting on sirtuins.\tLongevity, lifespan, cancer, cellular transformation, energy, calorie restriction, diabetes--what can tie together such a diversity of hot topics in biomedical research? Emerging findings suggest that the answer lies in understanding the functions of the recently discovered family of proteins known as Sirtuins. Barcelona hosted the first scientific meeting completely focused on these evolutionary conserved protein deacetylases, bringing together experts in the biochemistry to cellular biology, mice models, drug targeting and pathophysiology of these molecules. Their work, summarized here, establishes the Sirtuins as major players in cellular homeostasis and human diseases that act through a",
    "Sirtuins in cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sirtuins are a family of enzymes highly conserved in evolution and involved in mechanisms known to promote healthy ageing and longevity. This review aims to discuss recent advances in understanding the role of sirtuins, in particular mammalian SIRT1, in promoting longevity and its potential molecular basis for neuroprotection against cognitive ageing and Alzheimer's disease pathology. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulative increase in oxidative stress during ageing has been shown to decrease SIRT1 activity in catabolic tissue, possibly by direct inactivation by reactive oxygen. SIRT1 overexpression prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and increases resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors.",
    "Do Sirtuins Promote Mammalian Longevity?: A Critical Review on Its Relevance to the Longevity Effect Induced by Calorie Restriction\tSirtuins (SIRTs), a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases, are emerging as key molecules that regulate aging and age-related diseases including cancers, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Seven isoforms of SIRT (SIRT1\u20137) have been identified in mammals. SIRT1 and 6, mainly localized in the nucleus, regulate transcription of genes and DNA repair. SIRT3 in the mitochondria regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics. Initial studies in yeasts, nematodes, and flies indicated a strong connection of SIRT with the life-prolonging effects of calorie restriction (CR), a",
    "SIRT1 Decrease Parallels the Accumulation of tau in Alzheimer Disease\tAging and metabolism-related disorders are risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD). Since sirtuins may increase the lifespan through regulation of cellular metabolism, we compared the concentration of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the brains of AD patients (n = 19) and controls (n = 22) using Western immunoblots and in situ hybridization. We report a significant reduction of SIRT1 (mRNA: \u221229%; protein: \u221245%) in the parietal cortex of AD patients, but not in the cerebellum. Further analyses in a second cohort of 36 subjects confirmed that cortical SIRT1 was decreased in the cortex of AD patients"
