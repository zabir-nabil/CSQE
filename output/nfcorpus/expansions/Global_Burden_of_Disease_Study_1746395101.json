    "The Global Burden of Disease Study is a comprehensive research project that aims to quantify the impact of diseases, injuries, and risk factors on populations around the world. By analyzing data from various sources, including surveys, health records, and scientific literature, the study provides valuable insights into the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Through this research, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and public health experts can better understand the health challenges faced by different regions and populations, allowing for the development of more effective strategies for prevention and treatment. The findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study play a crucial role in guiding public health initiatives and resource allocation to improve the overall health and well-being of communities worldwide.",
    "The Global Burden of Disease Study is a comprehensive effort to quantify the impact of various health conditions and risk factors on populations worldwide.

    "A comparative risk assessment of burden of disease and injury attributable to 67 risk factors and risk factor clusters in 21 regions, 1990\u20132010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010\tSummary Background Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [",
    "Forecasting the global burden of Alzheimer's disease.\tBACKGROUND: Our goal was to forecast the global burden of Alzheimer's disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progression. METHODS: A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43% of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing",
    "Epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in China, 1990-2010: a systematic review and analysis.\tBACKGROUND: China is increasingly facing the challenge of control of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. We assessed the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in China between 1990, and 2010, to improve estimates of the burden of disease, analyse time trends, and inform health policy decisions relevant to China's rapidly ageing population. METHODS: In our systematic review we searched for reports of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in China, published in Chinese and English between 1990 and 2010. We searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang",

OBJECTIVES: To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. DESIGN: We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk",
    "A global view on the development of non communicable diseases.\tFor a long time non communicable diseases (NCDs) were discussed as burden of the developed world. Recent alarming data show a reverse trend and a dramatic increase of NCDs in the developing world, in particular in highly populated transition countries. This is true for the main mortality triggering diseases such as CVD, cancer or diabetes. Almost 4 out of 5 NCD based deaths happen in low- and middle income countries. This development is multi-factorial and is based on some main trends such as globalization, supermarket growth, rapid urbanization and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. The latter leads to overweight or obesity, which again promotes",

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.

    "Aquaculture practices and potential human health risks: current knowledge and future priorities.\tAnnual global aquaculture production has more than tripled within the past 15 years, and by 2015, aquaculture is predicted to account for 39% of total global seafood production by weight. Given that lack of adequate nutrition is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease, increased food production through aquaculture is a seemingly welcome sign. However, as production surges, aquaculture facilities increasingly rely on the heavy input of formulated feeds, antibiotics, antifungals, and agrochemicals. This review summarizes our current knowledge concerning major chemical, biological and emerging agents that are employed in modern aquaculture facilities and their potential impacts on",
    "Influencing public nutrition for non-communicable disease prevention: from community intervention to national programme--experiences from Finland.\tA global health transition is currently underway. The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing rapidly in the developing world, very much as a result of changes in lifestyles. In addition to changes in tobacco use and physical activity, major changes are taking place in diets, contributing greatly to the growing epidemic of NCD. Thus, a huge global public health challenge is how to influence the trends in diet and nutrition for effective global NCD prevention. The health transition took place rapidly in Finland after World War II and mortality from cardiovascular disease (",
    "The environmental and public health risks associated with arsenical use in animal feeds.\tArsenic exposures contribute significantly to the burden of preventable disease worldwide, specifically related to increased risks of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Most exposures are associated with natural contamination of groundwater, which is difficult to mitigate when these sources are used for drinking water. An anthropogenic source of arsenic exposure stems from the widespread use of arsenical drugs in food-animal production in the United States and China, among many countries. This use results in residual contamination of food products from animals raised with the drugs, as well as environmental contamination associated with disposal of wastes from these animals. Land disposal of",
    "Use of statistics to assess the global burden of breast cancer.\tA variety of statistics are used to quantify the burden (occurrence and outcome) of cancer generally and of breast cancer specifically. When undertaking any cancer control program, understanding these statistics, their source, and their quality is important for assessing the current situation, allocating resources to different control strategies, and evaluating progress. Two core statistics are the cancer incidence rate and the cancer mortality rate, which provide estimates of the average risk of acquiring and of dying from the disease, respectively. About 16% of the world's population is covered by registration systems that produce cancer incidence statistics, while mortality data are"
