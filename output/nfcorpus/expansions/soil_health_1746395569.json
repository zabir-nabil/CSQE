    "Soil health refers to the overall quality and fertility of soil, which is essential for sustaining plant growth and ecosystem functions. It is determined by various factors such as soil composition, structure, pH levels, nutrient availability, and organic matter content. Healthy soil provides a supportive environment for plant roots to access nutrients and water, promoting robust plant growth and high crop yields. Maintaining soil health is crucial for sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation, as it helps to prevent soil erosion, retain water, sequester carbon, and support biodiversity. Adopting practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, minimal tillage, and organic farming can help improve and preserve soil health for current and future generations. By prioritizing soil health, we can ensure productive and resilient agricultural systems while protecting the long-term sustainability of our planet.",

    "soil health The connection between farm-generated animal waste and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities, via mobile genetic elements, remains obscure. A disparity existed between the two sites with regard to soil pH, tetracycline resistance levels among culturable soil bacteria, and the incidence and prevalence of several tet and erm genes in the soils. People often buy organic food because they believe organic farms produce more nutritious and better tasting food from healthier soils. We tested if there are significant differences in fruit and soil quality from 13 pairs of commercial organic and conventional strawberry agroecosystems in California. In organic farming, phosphate fertilizers are not used, which may in the long term result in lower Cd levels. Feed, kidney, liver, and manure from growing/finishing pigs raised conventionally and organically on the same farm were microwave-digested and analyzed for Cd by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Diverticular disease appears to be related to increasing affluence and changed diet: Current theory holds that diverticular disease's origin is low-fiber diet. This explains why its incidence is highest and accelerating in the more prosperous countries where intake of fiber has decreased and intake of milled grains and refined sugars has increased over time.",

    "Detection of a Common and Persistent tet(L)-Carrying Plasmid in Chicken-Waste-Impacted Farm Soil\tThe connection between farm-generated animal waste and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities, via mobile genetic elements, remains obscure. In this study, electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveying of a broiler chicken farm assisted soil sampling from a chicken-waste-impacted site and a marginally affected site. Consistent with the EMI survey, a disparity existed between the two sites with regard to soil pH, tetracycline resistance (Tcr) levels among culturable soil bacteria, and the incidence and prevalence of several tet and erm genes in the soils. No significant difference was observed in these",
    "Fruit and Soil Quality of Organic and Conventional Strawberry Agroecosystems\tBackground Sale of organic foods is one of the fastest growing market segments within the global food industry. People often buy organic food because they believe organic farms produce more nutritious and better tasting food from healthier soils. Here we tested if there are significant differences in fruit and soil quality from 13 pairs of commercial organic and conventional strawberry agroecosystems in California. Methodology/Principal Findings At multiple sampling times for two years, we evaluated three varieties of strawberries for mineral elements, shelf life, phytochemical composition, and organoleptic properties. We also analyzed traditional soil properties and soil DNA using microarray technology. We found that the organic farms",
    "Longitudinal Study of the Contamination of Air and of Soil Surfaces in the Vicinity of Pig Barns by Livestock-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus\tDuring 1 year, samples were taken on 4 days, one sample in each season, from pigs, the floor, and the air inside pig barns and from the ambient air and soil at different distances outside six commercial livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA)-positive pig barns in the north and east of Germany. LA-MRSA was isolated from animals, floor, and air samples in the barn, showing a range of airborne LA-MRSA between 6 and 3,619 CFU/m3 (median, 151 CFU",
    "Cadmium in organic and conventional pig production.\tThe main sources of cadmium (Cd) input to soils have been phosphate fertilizers and deposition from air. In organic farming, phosphate fertilizers are not used, which may in the long term result in lower Cd levels. In the present study, feed, kidney, liver, and manure from growing/finishing pigs raised conventionally and organically on the same farm were microwave-digested and analyzed for Cd by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Cd was also analyzed in soil and water. A quality control program was included. The organic pigs (n = 40) were raised outdoors and fed an organic feed; the conventional pigs",
    "Occurrence, fate, and biodegradation of estrogens in sewage and manure.\tThe estrogens estrone (E1), 17alpha-estradiol (E2alpha), 17beta-estradiol (E2beta), and estriol (E3) are natural sex hormones produced by humans and animals. In addition, there are some synthetic estrogens, such as 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), used for contraception purposes. These compounds are able to produce endocrine disruption in living organisms at nanogram-per-liter levels. In both humans and animals, estrogens are excreted in urine and feces, reaching the natural environment through discharge from sewage treatment plants (STP) and manure disposal units. In STPs, hormone",
    "Heavy metals in wild rice from northern Wisconsin.\tWild rice grain samples from various parts of the world have been found to have elevated concentrations of heavy metals, raising concern for potential effects on human health. It was hypothesized that wild rice from north-central Wisconsin could potentially have elevated concentrations of some heavy metals because of possible exposure to these elements from the atmosphere or from water and sediments. In addition, no studies of heavy metals in wild rice from Wisconsin had been performed, and a baseline study was needed for future comparisons. Wild rice plants were collected from four areas in Bayfield, Forest, Langlade, Oneida, Sawyer and Wood Counties in September, 1997",
    "Food Animals and Antimicrobials: Impacts on Human Health\tSummary: Antimicrobials are valuable therapeutics whose efficacy is seriously compromised by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The provision of antibiotics to food animals encompasses a wide variety of nontherapeutic purposes that include growth promotion. The concern over resistance emergence and spread to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices and opinions. Considerable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic antimicrobials (NTAs) in Europe, based on the \u201cprecautionary principle.\u201d Still, concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of NTAs is not clear to all stakeholders. Substantial data show elevated antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed NTAs and their",
    "Rapamycin (AY-22,989), a new antifungal antibiotic. I. Taxonomy of the producing streptomycete and isolation of the active principle.\tA streptomycete was isolated from an Easter Island soil sample and found to inhibit Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton granulosum. The antibiotic-producing microorganism was characterized and identified as Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The antifungal principle was extracted with organic solvent from the mycelium, isolated in crystalline form and named rapamycin. Rapamycin is mainly active against Candida albicans; minimum inhibitory concentration against ten strains ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 mug/ml. Its apparent activity against Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton granulosum is lower because of its instability in culture media on prolonged incubation required by these fungi",
    "In vitro binding capacities of three dietary fibers and their mixture for four toxic elements, cholesterol, and bile acid.\tWater-soluble dietary fibers from apple peels and water-insoluble dietary fibers from wheat bran and soybean-seed hull were used to evaluate their binding capacities for four toxic elements (Pb, Hg, Cd, and As), lard, cholesterol, and bile acids. The water-soluble dietary fibers showed a higher binding capacity for three toxic cations, cholesterol, and sodium cholate; and a lower binding capacity for lard, compared to the water-insoluble ones. A mixture of the dietary fibers from all samples - apple peels, wheat bran",
    "Diverticular disease: eat your fiber!\tIn industrialized nations, diverticular disease affects up to 70% of individuals by 60 years of age, with symptoms that can range from mild gastrointestinal disturbance to incapacitating pain. Diverticular disease appears to be related to increasing affluence and changed diet: Current theory holds that diverticular disease's origin is low-fiber diet. This explains why its incidence is highest and accelerating in the more prosperous countries where intake of fiber has decreased and intake of milled grains and refined sugars has increased over time. Not all patients develop symptoms, but if they do, the most frequent complaints associated with diverticulosis are cramping in the left-lower quadrant, bloating"
