    "poultry workers, Poultry workers are exposed to ALSV and other infectious agents in the workplace. We found that the antibody levels were significantly higher in poultry workers than in control subjects. Workers in poultry plants have high exposure to a variety of transmissible agents present in poultry and their products. We report here on mortality from non-malignant diseases in a cohort of poultry workers. The objectives of this study are to examine whether a similar association can be found with REV antibody levels and to examine the correlation between REV and ALSV antibody levels. Relative risk was estimated comparing REV antibody levels of 45 poultry workers with those of 44 controls. To test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers and in the general population may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers. New occupational findings were recorded respectively for pancreatic/liver cancers, for slaughtering of poultry. The role of zoonotic biological agents in human cancer occurrence has been little studied. To study cancer mortality in the largest cohort to date of 20,132 workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, a group with the highest human exposures to these viruses. We studied mortality in two separate cohorts of workers in abattoirs and meat processing plants belonging to a meatcutters' union, because they were exposed to viruses that cause cancer in food animals, and also to chemical carcinogens at work. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were estimated for each cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex.",

    "Occupational exposure assessment using antibody levels: exposure to avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses in the poultry industry.\tAvian leukosis/sarcoma viruses (ALSV) infect and cause cancers in chickens. Poultry workers are exposed to ALSV and other infectious agents in the workplace. This study examines if industrial hygiene assessment of antibody levels in poultry workers can identify risky job tasks at the higher exposure risk to an infectious agent, i.e., ALSV. We compared ALSV antibody levels in poultry workers and control subjects. Occupational and demographical factors were examined for an association with the exposure risk in poultry workers. We found that the antibody levels were significantly higher in poultry workers than in control subjects. Job",
    "Mortality in the Baltimore union poultry cohort: non-malignant diseases.\tBACKGROUND: Workers in poultry plants have high exposure to a variety of transmissible agents present in poultry and their products. Subjects in the general population are also exposed. It is not known whether many of these agents cause disease in humans. If they do, we reason this would be readily evident in a highly exposed group such as poultry workers. We report here on mortality from non-malignant diseases in a cohort of poultry workers. METHODS: Mortality was compared with that of the US general population, and with that of a comparison group from the same union. Risk was estimated by standardized mortality",
    "Industrial hygiene assessment of reticuloendotheliosis viruses exposure in the poultry industry.\tOBJECTIVES: Reticuloendotheliosis viruses (REV) are a group of retroviruses like avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses (ALSV) that naturally infect and cause cancers in chickens. We recently found that ALSV antibody levels were associated with job tasks in the poultry industry. The objectives of this study are to examine whether a similar association can be found with REV antibody levels and to examine the correlation between REV and ALSV antibody levels. METHODS: Relative risk was estimated comparing REV antibody levels of 45 poultry workers with those of 44 controls. The expected mean antibody level was predicted for the association with employment by a generalized linear model",
    "A pilot case-cohort study of liver and pancreatic cancers in poultry workers.\tPURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers and in the general population, may be associated with increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers, and to identify new risk factors. METHODS: A pilot case-cohort study of both cancers within a combined cohort of 30,411 highly exposed poultry workers and 16,408 control subjects was conducted, and risk assessed by logistic regression odds ratios (OR) and proportional hazards risk ratios. RESULTS: New occupational findings were recorded respectively for pancreatic/liver cancers, for slaughtering of poultry (OR =",
    "Mortality from malignant diseases-update of the Baltimore union poultry cohort.\tWe previously studied mortality up to 1989 in 2,639 members of a local union who had ever worked in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, because they were exposed to oncogenic viruses present in poultry. In this report, cancer mortality was updated to the year 2003 for 2,580 of the 2,639 subjects who worked exclusively in poultry plants. Mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the US general population through the estimation of proportional mortality and standardized mortality ratios separately for each race/sex group and for the whole cohort. Compared to the US general population, an excess of cancers of the buccal and nasal cavities",
    "Cancer mortality in poultry slaughtering/processing plant workers belonging to a union pension fund.\tBACKGROUND: The role of zoonotic biological agents in human cancer occurrence has been little studied. Humans are commonly exposed to viruses that naturally infect and cause cancer in food animals such as poultry that constitute part of the biological environment. It is not known if these viruses cause cancer in humans. OBJECTIVE: To study cancer mortality in the largest cohort to date, of 20,132 workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, a group with the highest human exposures to these viruses. METHODS: Mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the US general population through the estimation of standardized mortality ratios",
    "Evaluation of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and sister chromatid exchanges in hospital workers chronically exposed to ionizing radiation.\tCytogenetic analysis was performed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hospital workers chronically exposed to ionizing radiation in comparison to matched non-exposed individuals. The accumulated absorbed doses calculated for the radiation workers ranged from 9.5 to 209.4 mSv. The endpoints used were chromosomal aberrations (CA), micronuclei (MN), and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE). The frequencies of CA/100 cells observed for the exposed group were significantly (P=0.018) higher than in the control group: 3.2 and 2.6, respectively. Similarly, the mean numbers of SCE per cell were statistically higher (P=0.025)",
    "Cancer mortality in workers employed in cattle, pigs, and sheep slaughtering and processing plants.\tOBJECTIVES: We studied mortality in two separate cohorts of workers in abattoirs (N=4996) and meat processing plants (N=3642) belonging to a meatcutters' union, because they were exposed to viruses that cause cancer in food animals, and also to chemical carcinogens at work. METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were estimated for each cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex, using the US general population mortality rates for comparison. Study subjects were followed up from January 1950 to December 2006, during which time over 60",
    "Popcorn-worker lung caused by corporate and regulatory negligence: an avoidable tragedy.\tDiacetyl-containing butter flavor was identified as the cause of an outbreak of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and other lung diseases in popcorn-plant workers. Litigation documents show that the outbreak was both predictable and preventable. The industry trade organization was aware of BO cases in workers at butter-flavoring and popcorn-manufacturing plants but often failed to implement industrial hygiene improvements and actively hid pertinent warning information. Due to weaknesses in the organization and mandates of regulatory bodies, organizations such as NIOSH, OSHA, the FDA, particularly the \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) system, and",
    "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Strain ST398 Is Present in Midwestern U.S. Swine and Swine Workers\tBackground Recent research has demonstrated that many swine and swine farmers in the Netherlands and Canada are colonized with MRSA. However, no studies to date have investigated carriage of MRSA among swine and swine farmers in the United States (U.S.). Methods We sampled the nares of 299 swine and 20 workers from two different production systems in Iowa and Illinois, comprising approximately 87,000 live animals. MRSA isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI and EagI restriction enzymes, and by multi locus sequence typing (MLST). PCR was used to determine SCCmec type"
