    "Saturated fat is a type of dietary fat that is typically solid at room temperature and is commonly found in animal products such as butter, cheese, and fatty cuts of meat, as well as some tropical oils like coconut oil and palm oil. Consuming too much saturated fat can increase levels of LDL cholesterol, also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, which can contribute to heart disease and other health problems. It is important to limit intake of saturated fats and instead focus on healthier fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in foods like nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish. By making conscious choices to reduce saturated fat consumption and increase intake of healthier fats, one can promote better heart health and overall well-being.",
    "Saturated fat is a type of dietary fat that is typically solid at room temperature and is commonly found in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs, as well as some plant-based oils like coconut and palm oil. Consuming high amounts of saturated fat has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and other health issues. It is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fat and instead focus on incorporating healthier fats like mono- and polyunsaturated fats into your diet, such as those found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil. Making these dietary changes can help to support overall heart health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases associated with high saturated fat consumption."

    "saturated fat, A reduction in dietary saturated fat has generally been thought to improve cardiovascular health. Objective: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence related to the association of dietary saturated fat with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD; CHD inclusive of stroke) in prospective epidemiologic studies. High dietary intake of saturated fat is associated with reduced semen quality among 701 young Danish men from the general population. Saturated fat intake has been associated with both cardiovascular disease and cancer risk. Substituting dietary saturated for monounsaturated fat impairs insulin sensitivity in healthy men and women: The KANWU Study. The amount and quality of fat in the diet could be of importance for the development of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders. The IOM did not set ULs for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol because any intake level above 0% of energy increased LDL cholesterol concentration. These three food components are unavoidable in ordinary diets. Several nutrition and non-nutritional pathways are recognized in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. Log-transformed fasting insulin was significantly associated with body mass index, abdomen-hip ratio, total fat energy, and saturated fatty acid energy. When multivariate models were used, body mass index, abdomen-hip ratio, and saturated fatty acid intake remained significant.",

    "Mediterranean and low-fat diets improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men.\tBACKGROUND: The regulatory function of the endothelium is altered in hypercholesterolemia, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients is affected by replacing a saturated fat-enriched diet with a low-fat, low-saturated fat diet (the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program stage 1 [NCEP-1] diet) or a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (such as that common in Mediterranean countries). DESIGN: Intervention dietary study with a baseline phase and two randomized crossover dietary periods. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Reina Sof\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba",

    "Dietary fat and semen quality among men attending a fertility clinic\tBACKGROUND The objective of this study was to examine the relation between dietary fats and semen quality parameters. METHODS Data from 99 men with complete dietary and semen quality data were analyzed. Fatty acid levels in sperm and seminal plasma were measured using gas chromatography in a subgroup of men (n = 23). Linear regression was used to determine associations while adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS Men were primarily Caucasian (89%) with a mean (SD) age of 36.4 (5.3) years; 71% were overweight or obese; and 67% were never smokers. Higher total fat intake was negatively related to",
    "Dietary saturated fat intake is negatively associated with weight maintenance among the PREMIER participants.\tResearch finding on the composition of macronutrient intakes on body weight has not been consistent. Furthermore, little research has examined the impact of subcomponents of macronutrients such as saturated fat or plant protein on body weight. The purpose of this report was to examine the impact of saturated fat, animal and plant protein, and other macronutrient intakes at the end of an intensive intervention on subsequent follow-up body weight. This is a secondary, observational data analysis using data from PREMIER, an 18-month randomized clinical trial that enrolled a total of 810 participants.

    "Tolerable upper intake levels for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.\tTolerable upper intake levels (ULs) set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are important, in part because they are used for estimating the percentage of the population at potential risk of adverse effects from excessive nutrient intake. The IOM did not set ULs for trans fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol because any intake level above 0% of energy increased LDL cholesterol concentration and these three food components are unavoidable in ordinary diets. The purpose of the analysis presented in this review was to evaluate clinical trial and prospective observational data that were not previously considered for setting a UL with the aim of",
