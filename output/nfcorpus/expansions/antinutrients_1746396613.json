    "Antinutrients are compounds found in various foods that interfere with the absorption of nutrients in the body. While some antinutrients are naturally occurring and serve a protective role for plants, others can have negative effects on human health when consumed in high amounts. Examples of antinutrients include phytates, oxalates, tannins, and lectins. These compounds can bind to minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium, making them less available for absorption. Cooking, soaking, fermenting, or sprouting foods high in antinutrients can help reduce their levels and improve the bioavailability of essential nutrients. It's important to be aware of antinutrients in your diet and consume a variety of foods to ensure adequate nutrient intake.",

    "The role of phytic acid in legumes: antinutrient or beneficial function?\tThis review describes the present state of knowledge about phytic acid (phytate), which is often present in legume seeds. The antinutritional effects of phytic acid primarily relate to the strong chelating associated with its six reactive phosphate groups. Its ability to complex with proteins and particularly with minerals has been a subject of investigation from chemical and nutritional viewpoints. The hydrolysis of phytate into inositol and phosphates or phosphoric acid occurs as a result of phytase or nonenzymatic cleavage. Enzymes capable of hydrolysing phytates are widely distributed in micro-organisms, plants and animals. Phytases act in a stepwise manner to catalyse the hydrolysis of"
