    "Apple cider vinegar has gained popularity for its potential health benefits. Many people believe that it can help with weight loss, improve digestion, and even lower blood sugar levels. However, it's important to note that scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited. While some studies have shown positive effects of apple cider vinegar on certain health markers, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on overall health. Additionally, apple cider vinegar is highly acidic and can cause irritation or damage to the esophagus and tooth enamel when consumed in large amounts. As with any dietary supplement, it is best to consult with a healthcare provider before incorporating apple cider vinegar into your routine to ensure it is safe and appropriate for you.",

    "Is apple cider vinegar good for you? The warts resisted treatment with salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar and an over-the-counter blend. This study investigated the vinegar dosage (10 vs. 20 g), timing (during mealtime vs. 5 h before meal) and application (acetic acid as vinegar vs. neutralized salt) for reducing postprandial glycemia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible influence of acetic acid (administered as vinegar) on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses, and the potential involvement of a modified gastric emptying rate was studied by use of paracetamol as a marker. To investigate the potential of acetic acid supplementation as a means of lowering the glycemic index (GI) of a bread meal, and to evaluate the possible dose-response effect on postprandial glycemia, insulinaemia and satiety.",

    "Esophageal injury by apple cider vinegar tablets and subsequent evaluation of products.\tApple cider vinegar products are advertised in the popular press and over the Internet for treatment of a variety of conditions. After an adverse event was reported to the authors, eight apple cider vinegar tablet products were tested for pH, component acid content, and microbial growth. Considerable variability was found between the brands in tablet size, pH, component acid content, and label claims. Doubt remains as to whether apple cider vinegar was in fact an ingredient in the evaluated products. The inconsistency and inaccuracy in labeling, recommended dosages, and unsubstantiated health claims make it easy to question the quality of the products",
    "Topical vitamin A treatment of recalcitrant common warts.\tBACKGROUND: Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are benign epithelial proliferations associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salicylic acid and cryotherapy are the most frequent treatments for common warts, but can be painful and cause scarring, and have high failure and recrudescence rates. Topical vitamin A has been shown to be a successful treatment of common warts in prior informal studies. CASE: The subject is a healthy, physically-active 30 old female with a 9 year history of common warts on the back of the right hand. The warts resisted treatment with salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar and an over-the-counter blend",
    "Efficacy of home washing methods in controlling surface microbial contamination on fresh produce.\tMuch effort has been focused on sanitation of fresh produce at the commercial level; however, few options are available to the consumer. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of different cleaning methods in reducing bacterial contamination on fresh produce in a home setting. Lettuce, broccoli, apples, and tomatoes were inoculated with Listeria innocua and then subjected to combinations of the following cleaning procedures: (i) soak for 2 min in tap water, Veggie Wash solution, 5% vinegar solution, or 13% lemon solution and (ii) rinse under running tap water, rinse and rub",
    "Arsenic and lead in juice: apple, citrus, and apple-base.\tExposure limits for arsenic and lead in drinking water have long been established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and new regulations regarding the presence of these contaminants in bottled water went into effect in California in 2009. No comparable exposure limits or regulations are available, however, for juices and other beverages that may contain arsenic and lead. In the study described in this article, 20 apple juices (or ciders), 15 apple-containing juices, one grape, and one citrus juice were analyzed for arsenic and lead. Arsenic was detected in all juices while lead was detected in more than 94",
    "Identification of metabolites in human plasma and urine after consumption of a polyphenol-rich juice drink.\tA polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was developed as a potential approach to increase intake of dietary polyphenols. Analysis of the beverage by HPLC with PDA, fluorescence, and MS detection facilitated the identification/partial identification of 40 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds. The main constituents were (-)-epigallocatechin and other green tea flavan-3-ols, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside, gallic acid, hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and procyanidins, with trace levels of several flavonols and purple grape juice anthocyanins also being present. Healthy human subjects (n",
    "Diet, lung function, and lung function decline in a cohort of 2512 middle aged men\tBACKGROUND\u2014A prospective cohort study of 2512 Welshmen aged 45-59 living in Caerphilly in 1979-1983 was used to investigate associations between diet and lung function. METHODS\u2014At baseline (phase I) and at five year follow up (phase II), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured using a McDermott spirometer and dietary data were obtained using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS\u2014Good lung function, indicated by high maximum FEV1 given age and height, was associated with high intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, \u03b2-carotene",
    "Examination of the antiglycemic properties of vinegar in healthy adults.\tBACKGROUND: Vinegar reduces postprandial glycemia (PPG) in healthy adults. This study investigated the vinegar dosage (10 vs. 20 g), timing (during mealtime vs. 5 h before meal) and application (acetic acid as vinegar vs. neutralized salt) for reducing PPG. METHODS: Four randomized crossover trials were conducted in adults (n = 9-10/trial) with type 2 diabetes (1 trial) or without diabetes (3 trials). All trials followed the same protocol: a standardized meal the evening prior to testing, an overnight fast ( 1 10 h) and 2-hour glucose testing",
    "Viscous versus nonviscous soluble fiber supplements: mechanisms and evidence for fiber-specific health benefits.\tPURPOSE: This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. DATA SOURCES: Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. CONCLUSIONS: While it is generally known that \"fiber is good for you,\" it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Many of the health benefits of fiber can be directly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers when hydrated (i.e.",
    "Delayed gastric emptying rate may explain improved glycaemia in healthy subjects to a starchy meal with added vinegar.\tOBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible influence of acetic acid (administered as vinegar) on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses, and the potential involvement of a modified gastric emptying rate was studied by use of paracetamol as a marker. DESIGN: The white bread reference meal as well as the corresponding meal supplemented with vinegar had the same content of starch, protein and fat. The meals were served in the morning after an over-night fast and in random order. Capillary blood samples for analysis of glucose, insulin and paracetamol were collected postprandially",
