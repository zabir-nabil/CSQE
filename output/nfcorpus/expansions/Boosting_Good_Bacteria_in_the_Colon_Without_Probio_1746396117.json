    "Enhancing the population of beneficial bacteria in the colon can be achieved through various natural methods aside from using probiotics. One effective way is by consuming fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Fiber acts as a prebiotic, providing nourishment for the good bacteria in the gut. Additionally, incorporating fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi into your diet can promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria. These foods contain natural probiotics that can help maintain a balanced gut flora. Furthermore, staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water supports digestion and aids in the growth of beneficial bacteria. Regular exercise also plays a role in promoting good gut health by improving overall digestion and circulation. By making these simple lifestyle modifications, you can boost the levels of good bacteria in your colon and support your digestive health without relying solely on probiotic supplements.",

    "Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics, DNA damage is an essential component of the genesis of colonic cancer. Gut microbial products and food components are thought to be principally responsible for the damage that initiates disease progression. To examine the hypothesis that the influence of diet on colon cancer risk is mediated by the microbiota through their metabolites, we measured differences in colonic microbes and their metabolites in African Americans with a high risk and in rural native Africans with a low risk of colon cancer.",
    "Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics, DNA damage is an essential component of the genesis of colonic cancer. Gut microbial products and food components are thought to be principally responsible for the damage that initiates disease progression. Their relevance to oncogenesis remains to be confirmed, as does the relative importance of different mutagenic and genotoxic compounds present in fecal water and the bacteria involved in their metabolism. Survival under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions showed that 35% of the strains, mainly belonging to the species Lactobacillus plantarum maintained high cell densities. All strains stimulated all 27 immune-mediators by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A significant (P<0.05; P<0.01) increase of the major part of cytokines and growth factors was found. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic colon cancer can be attributed to diet. Background: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic colon cancer can be attributed to diet."

    "The impact of meals on a probiotic during transit through a model of the human upper gastrointestinal tract.\tCommercial literature on various probiotic products suggests that they can be taken before meals, during meals or after meals or even without meals. This has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumer. The objective of our study was to examine the impact of the time of administration with respect to mealtime and the impact of the buffering capacity of the food on the survival of probiotic microbes during gastrointestinal transit. We used an in vitro Digestive System (IViDiS) model of the upper gastrointestinal tract to examine the survival of a commercial multi-strain probiotic, ProtecFlor\u00ae.",
    "Recent Perspectives on the Relations between Fecal Mutagenicity, Genotoxicity, and Diet\tDNA damage is an essential component of the genesis of colonic cancer. Gut microbial products and food components are thought to be principally responsible for the damage that initiates disease progression. Modified Ames tests and Comet assays have been developed for measuring mutagenicity and genotoxicity. Their relevance to oncogenesis remains to be confirmed, as does the relative importance of different mutagenic and genotoxic compounds present in fecal water and the bacteria involved in their metabolism. Dietary intervention studies provide clues to the likely risks of oncogenesis. High-protein diets lead to increases in N-nitroso compounds in fecal water and greater DNA damage as measured by",
    "Novel probiotic candidates for humans isolated from raw fruits and vegetables.\tThis study was aimed at determining the probiotic potential of a large number of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from fruit and vegetables. Survival under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions showed that 35% of the strains, mainly belonging to the species Lactobacillus plantarum maintained high cell densities. Selected strains did not affect the immune-mediation by Caco-2 cells. All strains stimulated all 27 immune-mediators by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A significant (P<0.05; P<0.01) increase of the major part of cytokines and growth factors was found. A few chemokines were stimulated. Immune-mediators with pro-inflammatory activity",
    "The intestinal microflora in allergic Estonian and Swedish 2-year-old children.\tBACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic diseases seems to have increased particularly over the past 35-40 years. Furthermore, allergic disease is less common among children in the formerly socialist countries of central and Eastern Europe as compared with Western Europe. It has been suggested that a reduced microbial stimulation during infancy and early childhood would result in a slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between TH1- and TH2-like immunity. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that allergic disease among children may be associated with differences in their intestinal microflora in two countries with a low (Estonia",
    "Systemic immunity-enhancing effects in healthy subjects following dietary consumption of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001.\tOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the probiotic lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, on natural cellular immunity when delivered orally in normal low-fat milk (LFM) or lactose-hydrolyzed low-fat milk (LFM-LH). DESIGN: A three stage, pre-post intervention trial, spanning nine weeks. SETTING: Taipei Medical College Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. SUBJECTS: Fifty-two healthy middle-aged and elderly volunteers (17 males, 35 females; median age 63.5, range 44-80). INTERVENTIONS: Stage 1",
    "Microbiological evaluation of commercial probiotic products available in the USA in 2009.\tProbiotics are widely used to prevent and treat several diseases. Many commercial products are available worldwide. However, there is no clear international or local legislation about them and previous studies showed that most of the tested products are not in conformity with international guidelines. The aim of this study was to determine if products available in the USA market in 2009 were correctly labeled in terms of quantity of viable bacteria, identification of species and cross contamination by species not on the label. Disturbingly, we found that only 4 of 13 products (31%) were in accordance with label claims. Our results suggest the",
    "Why do African Americans get more colon cancer than Native Africans?\tThe incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is dramatically higher in African Americans (AAs) than in Native Africans (NAs) (60:100,000 vs. <1:100,000) and slightly higher than in Caucasian Americans (CAs). To explore whether the difference could be explained by interactions between diet and colonic bacterial flora, we compared randomly selected samples of healthy 50- to 65-y-old AAs (n = 17) with NAs (n = 18) and CAs (n = 17). Diet was measured by 3-d recall, and colonic metabolism by breath hydrogen and methane responses to oral lactulose.",
    "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of a probiotic in emotional symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome\tChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is complex illness of unknown etiology. Among the broad range of symptoms, many patients report disturbances in the emotional realm, the most frequent of which is anxiety. Research shows that patients with CFS and other so-called functional somatic disorders have alterations in the intestinal microbial flora. Emerging studies have suggested that pathogenic and non-pathogenic gut bacteria might influence mood-related symptoms and even behavior in animals and humans. In this pilot study, 39 CFS patients were randomized to receive either 24 billion colony forming units of Lactobacillus",
    "Faecal retention: a common cause in functional bowel disorders, appendicitis and haemorrhoids--with medical and surgical therapy.\tThe present studies explored whether faecal retention in the colon is a causative factor in functional bowel disease, appendicitis, and haemorrhoids. Faecal retention was characterized by colon transit time (CTT) after radio-opaque marker ingestion and estimation of faecal loading on abdominal radiographs at 48 h and 96 h. Specific hypotheses were tested in patients (n = 251 plus 281) and in healthy random controls (n = 44). A questionnaire was completed for each patient, covering abdominal and anorectal symptoms and without a priori grouping. Patients with functional bowel disorders, predominantly women",
    "Diet, microbiota, and microbial metabolites in colon cancer risk in rural Africans and African Americans\tBackground: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic colon cancer can be attributed to diet. The recognition that colonic microbiota have a major influence on colonic health suggests that they might mediate colonic carcinogenesis. Objective: To examine the hypothesis that the influence of diet on colon cancer risk is mediated by the microbiota through their metabolites, we measured differences in colonic microbes and their metabolites in African Americans with a high risk and in rural native Africans with a low risk of colon cancer. Design: Fresh fecal samples were collected from 12 healthy African Americans aged 50\u201365 y and from 12"
