    "Dental x-rays are generally considered safe when performed by trained professionals and with proper precautions in place. While the x-ray radiation exposes patients to a small amount of radiation, the levels are considered to be low and the benefits of detecting dental issues early often outweigh the risks. Dental x-rays are commonly used to diagnose problems such as cavities, gum disease, and tooth decay that may not be visible during a regular dental exam. Additionally, advancements in technology have led to the development of digital x-rays, which further reduce radiation exposure compared to traditional x-rays. It is important for patients to discuss any concerns about dental x-rays with their dentist to ensure that the benefits and risks are fully understood and balanced.",
    "Dental X-Rays are considered to be safe when performed by trained professionals following proper protocols. While X-rays do emit radiation, the amount used in dental procedures is minimal and typically not harmful to patients. The benefits of dental X-rays in detecting problems such as cavities, gum disease, and abnormalities in the teeth and jaw usually outweigh the risks. Additionally, modern technology has led to lower radiation doses and shorter exposure times during X-ray procedures, further enhancing safety for patients. Nonetheless, it is essential for dental providers to use protective measures like lead aprons and thyroid collars to further minimize any potential risks associated with X-rays. Overall, when used judiciously and in accordance with established guidelines, dental X-rays are considered safe and vital for proper diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry."

    "Dental X-rays and Risk of Meningioma\tContext Ionizing radiation is a consistently identified and potentially modifiable risk factor for meningioma, the most frequently reported primary brain tumor in the United States. Objective To examine the association between dental x-rays, the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation, and risk of intra-cranial meningioma. Design and Setting Population-based case-control study design. Participants The study includes 1433 intra-cranial meningioma cases aged 29-79 years diagnosed among residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area and eight Houston, Texas counties between May 1, 2006 and April 28, 2011 and 1350",
    "Generation of gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue and suppression of gas diffusion as an antitumour treatment.\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mechanisms of cancer cell growth and metastasis are still not entirely understood, especially from the viewpoint of chemical reactions in tumours. Glycolytic metabolism is markedly accelerated in cancer cells, causing the accumulation of glucose (a reducing sugar) and methionine (an amino acid), which can non-enzymatically react and form carcinogenic substances. There is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue. The aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferation. METHODS: Products formed",
    "Chlorhexidine (CHX) in dentistry: state of the art.\tChlorhexidine (CHX) is one of the most commonly prescribed antiseptic agents in the dental field. It has a long-lasting antibacterial activity with a broad-spectrum of action and it has been shown to reduce plaque, gingival inflammation and bleeding. Its use is considered a powerful adjuvant to mechanical oral hygiene (brushing and flossing), especially in those cases in which it cannot be performed correctly. Available as mouthwash, gel, aerosol, spray and disks, CHX is considered a safe compound, with minimal and transitory local and systemic side effects. Data support its periodic use as an adjuvant to",
    "Biocompatibility of micro- and nano-particles in the colon. Part II.\tPathological colonic tissues were investigated with an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope technique to verify the presence of inorganic, non-biodegradable pollutants, i.e. micro- and nano-debris of exogenous origin, after debris in liver and kidney had been discovered. In all, 18 samples of colon tissues affected by cancer and Crohn's disease were evaluated and found in all the cases to contain micro- and nano-particles. Their chemistry, detected with an X-ray microprobe, indicated a heterogeneous nature, whereas the size of the particles was homogeneous. Three control samples of healthy, young, cadavers were analysed and showed",
    "Attractive names sustain increased vegetable intake in schools.\tOBJECTIVE: This study will determine if the selective use of attractive names can be a sustainable, scalable means to increase the selection of vegetables in school lunchrooms. METHODS: Study 1 paired an attractive name with carrots in five elementary schools (n=147) and measured selection and consumption over a week compared to controls. Study 2 tracked food sales of vegetables in two elementary schools (n=1017) that were systematically attractively named or not named over a two-month period. Both studies were conducted in New York in 2011. RESULTS: Study 1 found that elementary students ate twice the percentage of their carrots if attractively named as \"",

    "Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) consumption is associated with higher bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.\tYerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) tea consumption is higher in Argentina and other South American countries than those of coffee or tea (Camellia sinensis). The effects of Yerba Mate on bone health have not previously been explored. From a program for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, postmenopausal women who drank at least 1 L of Yerba Mate tea daily during 4 or more years (n=146) were identified, and matched by age and time since menopause with an equal number of women who did not drink Yerba Mate tea. Their bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-",
    "Alkaline diets favor lean tissue mass in older adults\tBackground Maintaining muscle mass while aging is important to prevent falls and fractures. Metabolic acidosis promotes muscle wasting, and the net acid load from diets that are rich in net acid\u2013producing protein and cereal grains relative to their content of net alkali\u2013producing fruit and vegetables may therefore contribute to a reduction in lean tissue mass in older adults. Objective We aimed to determine whether there was an association of 24-h urinary potassium and an index of fruit and vegetable content of the diet with the percentage lean body mass (%LBM) or change in %LBM in older subjects. Design Subjects were 384 men and women",

    "Cerebral air gas embolism from concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion.\tINTRODUCTION: Ingestion of a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause cerebral air gas embolism (CAGE). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the standard of care in the treatment of CAGE. We report a case of CAGE after accidental ingestion of 33%hydrogen peroxide treated with HBOT resulting in reversal of both the clinical and radiologic abnormalities. CASE REPORT: A 48 year-old male took two sips of 33% hydrogen peroxide. A short time later, he developed hematemesis, left sided hemiplegia, confusion, and left homonymous hemianopsia. Initial laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and brain CT were normal."
