    "Believing in a scientific study involves understanding the methods and processes used to conduct the research. When evaluating a study, it's essential to consider factors such as the credibility of the researchers, the rigour of the methodology, the size and diversity of the sample, the control of variables, and the peer-review process. Scientific studies that have been published in reputable journals and have undergone rigorous peer-review are more likely to be reliable and trustworthy. It's important to critically analyze the study's findings, consider any potential biases or limitations, and compare the results with other relevant research in the field. By approaching scientific studies with a critical and open mind, considering the evidence, methodology, and context, we can make informed decisions about what to believe and apply in practice.",

    "How can you believe in any scientific study? The review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. While it is generally known that 'fiber is good for you,' it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Oxidative stress (OS) and damages due to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common causes of injuries to cells and organisms.

    "How can you believe in any scientific study? PURPOSE: This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. DATA SOURCES: Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. Concerns about foodborne salmonellosis have led many countries to introduce microbiological criteria for certain food products. Raw poultry products are an important part of the global food market. Li et al. (2011) now show that specific dietary compounds present in cruciferous vegetables act through the AhR to promote intestinal immune function, revealing AhR as a critical link between diet and immunity."

    "Viscous versus nonviscous soluble fiber supplements: mechanisms and evidence for fiber-specific health benefits.\tPURPOSE: This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. DATA SOURCES: Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. CONCLUSIONS: While it is generally known that \"fiber is good for you,\" it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Many of the health benefits of fiber can be directly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers when hydrated (i.e.",
    "The antiaging approach for the treatment of dry eye.\tDry eye is one of the most common eye disorders affecting millions of people. It causes ocular irritation or discomfort, and decreases functional vision, causing a dramatic deterioration in the quality of life. Although new treatments such as the P2Y2 agonist or cyclosporine eye drops have been developed and a certain level of patient satisfaction can now be obtained, no fundamental treatment has been developed. Currently, there is no therapy available to recover lacrimal function to its normal status. Recent progress in the understanding of aging has laid the foundations for a new way of thinking about intervention of the aging process. Because dry eye is accelerated by",
    "Scientific and technical factors affecting the setting of Salmonella criteria for raw poultry: a global perspective.\tConcerns about foodborne salmonellosis have led many countries to introduce microbiological criteria for certain food products. If such criteria are not well-grounded in science, they could be an unjustified obstacle to trade. Raw poultry products are an important part of the global food market. Import and export ambiguities and regulatory confusion resulting from different Salmonella requirements were the impetus for convening an international group of scientific experts from 16 countries to discuss the scientific and technical issues that affect the setting of a microbiological criterion for Salmonella contamination of raw chicken. A particular concern for the group was the use of criteria",
    "The Mediterranean Diet: A History of Health\tThe Mediterranean tradition offers a cousine rich in colors, aromas and memories, which support the taste and the spirit of those who live in harmony with nature. Everyone is talking about the Mediterranean diet, but few are those who do it properly, thus generating a lot of confusion in the reader. And so for some it coincides with the pizza, others identified it with the noodles with meat sauce, in a mixture of pseudo historical traditions and folklore that do not help to solve the question that is at the basis of any diet: combine and balance the food so as to satisfy the qualitative and quantitative needs of an",
    "Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: what you need to know.\tPURPOSE: We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of BPO related to BPH; and management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published literature and current treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO. RESULTS: BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is considerable risk of progression, and/or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve",
    "You AhR what you eat: linking diet and immunity.\tThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is responsible for the toxic effects of environmental pollutants such as dioxin, but little is known about its normal physiological functions. Li et al. (2011) now show that specific dietary compounds present in cruciferous vegetables act through the AhR to promote intestinal immune function, revealing AhR as a critical link between diet and immunity.

    "An open label, randomized, fixed-dose, crossover study comparing efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate and saffron (Crocus sativus Linn.) for t...\tSaffron (Crocus sativus Linn.) have been perceived by the public as a strong aphrodisiac herbal product. However, studies addressing the potential beneficial effects of saffron on erectile function (EF) in men with ED are lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saffron administration on EF in men with ED. After a 4-week baseline assessment, 346 men with ED (mean age 46.6+/-8.4 years) were randomized to receive on-demand sildenafil for 12 weeks followed by 30 mg saffron twice",
    "Does having a drink help you think? 6-7-Year-old children show improvements in cognitive performance from baseline to test after having a drink of ...\tLittle research has examined the effect of water consumption on cognition in children. We examined whether drinking water improves performance from baseline to test in twenty-three 6-7-year-old children. There were significant interactions between time of test and water group (water/no water), with improvements in the water group on thirst and happiness ratings, visual attention and visual search, but not visual memory or visuomotor performance. These results indicate that even under conditions of mild dehydration, not as a",
    "You Are What You Eat: Within-Subject Increases in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Confer Beneficial Skin-Color Changes\tBackground Fruit and vegetable consumption and ingestion of carotenoids have been found to be associated with human skin-color (yellowness) in a recent cross-sectional study. This carotenoid-based coloration contributes beneficially to the appearance of health in humans and is held to be a sexually selected cue of condition in other species. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we investigate the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on skin-color longitudinally to determine the magnitude and duration of diet change required to change skin-color perceptibly. Diet and skin-color were recorded at baseline and",
    "Brain rust: recent discoveries on the role of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.\tOxidative stress (OS) and damages due to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common causes of injuries to cells and organisms. The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (ND) increases with aging and much of the research involving ROS and OS has emerged from works in this field. This text reviews some recent published articles about the role of OS in ND. Since there are many reviews in this field, the focus was centered in articles published recently. The Scientific Journals Directory supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Education Office for the Coordination of Higher Educational Personnel Improvement (CAPES) was used"
