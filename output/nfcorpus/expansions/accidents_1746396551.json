    "Accidents are unexpected incidents that can cause harm or damage to people or property. They can occur anywhere, at any time, and for various reasons. Common causes of accidents include human error, negligence, environmental factors, mechanical failures, and natural disasters. It is important to take preventive measures to minimize the risk of accidents by following safety guidelines, maintaining equipment and vehicles, and being attentive and vigilant in all situations. In the event of an accident, it is crucial to remain calm, assess the situation, and seek help as needed to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved. By promoting awareness and practicing safety measures, we can work towards preventing accidents and creating a safer environment for ourselves and others.",

    "Bridging the gap in life expectancy of the aborigines in Taiwan.\tBACKGROUND: Similar to the general population in Taiwan, the health of aborigines has steadily improved over the last 30 years, but the gap remains wide, especially in males, despite an infusion of substantial medical resources. The objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of major causes of death to the gap in life expectancy and to propose initiatives to bridge the health gap between aborigines and the general population. METHODS: This study included residents (slightly over 200000) from 30 'aboriginal townships' in Taiwan. The gap in life expectancy between aborigines and the general population was analysed by decomposing these gaps",

    "Perceived risks of conventional and organic produce: pesticides, pathogens, and natural toxins.\tPublic risk perceptions and demand for safer food are important factors shaping agricultural production practices in the United States. Despite documented food safety concerns, little attempt has been made to elicit consumers' subjective risk judgments for a range of food safety hazards or to identify factors most predictive of perceived food safety risks. In this study, over 700 conventional and organic fresh produce buyers in the Boston area were surveyed for their perceived food safety risks. Survey results showed that consumers perceived relatively high risks associated with the consumption and production of conventionally grown produce compared with other public health hazards. For example,",

    "Perinatal Exposure to Low Doses of Dioxin Can Permanently Impair Human Semen Quality\tBackground In recent decades, young men in some industrialized areas have reportedly experienced a decrease in semen quality. Objective We examined effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on sperm quality and reproductive hormones. Methods We investigated sperm quality and hormone concentrations in 39 sons (mean age, 22.5 years) born between 1977 and 1984 to mothers exposed to dioxin after the accident in Seveso, Italy (1976), and 58 comparisons (mean age, 24.6 years) born to mothers exposed only to background dioxin. Maternal dioxin levels at conception were extrapolated from the concentrations measured in 1976 serum samples. Results The 21 breast-",
    "Meat intake and mortality: a prospective study of over half a million people\tContext High intakes of red or processed meat may increase risk of mortality. Objective Determine the relations of red, white and processed meat intakes to risk for total, and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort of half a million people aged 50-71 years at baseline. Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the models were: age; education",
    "Association of Coffee Drinking with Total and Cause-Specific Mortality\tBackground Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages, but the association between coffee consumption and the risk of death remains unclear. Methods We examined the association of coffee drinking with subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 229,119 men and 173,141 women in the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP Diet and Health Study who were 50 to 71 years of age at baseline. Participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke were excluded. Coffee consumption was assessed once at baseline.

    "Dietary cholesterol and egg yolks: Not for patients at risk of vascular disease\tA widespread misconception has been developing among the Canadian public and among physicians. It is increasingly believed that consumption of dietary cholesterol and egg yolks is harmless. There are good reasons for long-standing recommendations that dietary cholesterol should be limited to less than 200 mg/day; a single large egg yolk contains approximately 275 mg of cholesterol (more than a day\u2019s worth of cholesterol). Although some studies showed no harm from consumption of eggs in healthy people, this outcome may have been due to lack of power to detect clinically relevant increases in a low-risk population.
