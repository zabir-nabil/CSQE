    "Canker sores, also known as aphthous ulcers, are small, painful sores that appear inside the mouth, usually on the inner lips, cheeks, or tongue. While the exact cause of canker sores is not fully understood, potential factors may include stress, genetics, or a weakened immune system. These sores can be triggered by certain foods, hormonal changes, or oral injuries. Generally, canker sores will heal on their own within a week or two without leaving any lasting scars. Over-the-counter oral numbing agents or mouthwashes may help alleviate the pain and promote healing. However, if canker sores persist for an extended period, recur frequently, or are unusually large or painful, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment options.",

These sores can appear on the inside of the lips, cheeks, gums, or tongue, causing discomfort and making it difficult to eat or talk. Although the exact cause of canker sores is not well understood, they are thought to be triggered by factors such as stress, hormone changes, vitamin deficiencies, and certain foods or medications. Canker sores are not contagious and typically heal on their own within a week or two. In the meantime, over-the-counter oral gels or rinses can help to alleviate pain and promote healing.

    "Muscle soreness and delayed-onset muscle soreness.\tImmediate and delayed-onset muscle soreness differ mainly in chronology of presentation. Both conditions share the same quality of pain, eliciting and relieving activities and a varying degree of functional deficits. There is no single mechanism for muscle soreness; instead, it is a culmination of 6 different mechanisms. The developing pathway of DOMS begins with microtrauma to muscles and then surrounding connective tissues. Microtrauma is then followed by an inflammatory process and subsequent shifts of fluid and electrolytes. Throughout the progression of these events, muscle spasms may be present, exacerbating the overall condition. There are a multitude of modalities to manage the associated symptoms of immediate",
    "Watermelon juice: potential functional drink for sore muscle relief in athletes.\tl-Citrulline is an excellent candidate to reduce muscle soreness, and watermelon is a fruit rich in this amino acid. This study investigated the potential of watermelon juice as a functional drink for athletes. An in vitro study of intestinal absorption of l-citrulline in Caco-2 cells was performed using unpasteurized (NW), pasteurized (80 \u00b0C for 40 s) watermelon juice (PW) and, as control, a standard of l-citrulline. l-citrulline bioavailability was greater when it was contained in a matrix of watermelon and when no heat treatment was applied. In the in vivo experiment",
    "Whole-Body Vibration and the Prevention and Treatment of Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness\tContext: Numerous recovery strategies have been used in an attempt to minimize the symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Whole-body vibration (WBV) has been suggested as a viable warm-up for athletes. However, scientific evidence to support the protective effects of WBV training (WBVT) on muscle damage is lacking. Objective: To investigate the acute effect of WBVT applied before eccentric exercise in the prevention of DOMS. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 healthy, untrained volunteers were randomly assigned to",
    "Acute inflammation: the underlying mechanism in delayed onset muscle soreness?\tIt is well documented in animal and human research that unaccustomed eccentric muscle action of sufficient intensity and/or duration causes disruption of connective and/or contractile tissue. In humans, this appears to be associated with the sensation of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). During the late 1970's, it was proposed that this sensation of soreness might be associated with the acute inflammatory response. However, subsequent research failed to substantiate this theory. The present article suggests that the results of much of the research concerning DOMS reflect events typically seen in acute inflammation. Similarities between the two events include: the cardinal symptoms of pain,",
    "Migrating fish bone presenting as acute onset of neck lump.\tWe encountered a 62-year-old woman with a progressively worsening sore throat and a sharp lump located in her left upper neck, which appeared several hours before admission. After questioning, she underwent rigid esophagoscopy at a local hospital for suspected fish bone impaction but this gave a negative result. Unusual signs caused us to arrange a computed tomography scan, which showed that a foreign body had penetrated the left sternocleidomastoid muscle to the subcutaneous layer, with extensive emphysema in the neck. We extracted the foreign body with a 1-cm horizontal incision of the neck under general anesthesia. The patient returned to a normal",
    "Rheumatic fever: from sore throat to autoimmune heart lesions.\tMolecular mimicry between streptococci and heart components has been proposed as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In this review, we present data from cellular autoimmune responses, focusing on the interactions between HLA class II molecules, streptococcal peptides and heart tissue proteins and T-cell receptor (TCR) usage. HLA-DR7DR53 associated with DQ molecules seem to be related with the development of valvular lesions in severe RHD patients. DR7DR53 molecules were also involved in the recognition of an immunodominant M5 peptide in these patients. T cells infiltrating RHD hearts displayed several oligoclonal expansions. Intralesional T-cell",
    "Influence of tart cherry juice on indices of recovery following marathon running.\tThis investigation determined the efficacy of a tart cherry juice in aiding recovery and reducing muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative stress. Twenty recreational Marathon runners assigned to either consumed cherry juice or placebo for 5 days before, the day of and for 48 h following a Marathon run. Markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, muscle soreness and isometric strength), inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and uric acid], total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress [thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and protein carbonyls] were examined before and",
    "Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powde...\tCapsicum-derived ingredients function as skin-conditioning agents--miscellaneous, external analgesics, flavoring agents, or fragrance components in cosmetics. These ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5%. Cosmetic-grade material may be extracted using hexane, ethanol, or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the Capsicum annuum or Capsicum frutescens plant (aka red chiles), including Capsaicin. Aflatoxin and N-nitroso compounds (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) have been detected as"
