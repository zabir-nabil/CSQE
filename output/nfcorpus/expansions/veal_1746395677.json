    "Veal is a type of meat that comes from young calves, typically under three months old. Due to its pale color and tender texture, veal is often used in gourmet dishes and fine dining establishments. The production of veal has been a topic of controversy due to concerns about animal welfare, as calves are sometimes kept in confined spaces. However, there are more sustainable and ethical methods of veal production that prioritize the well-being of the animals. When cooked properly, veal can be a delicacy enjoyed by many, offering a unique flavor and versatility in various cuisines.",
    "Veal is a type of meat derived from young cattle, particularly calves. This tender and delicate meat is highly prized for its mild flavor and tenderness. Veal can be prepared in a variety of ways, whether it's breaded and fried as a classic veal cutlet, slow-cooked in a stew, or grilled to perfection. Despite its delicious taste, veal has been a topic of ethical debate due to the way calves are raised for meat production. It is important for consumers to be informed about the sourcing and treatment of veal products they choose to purchase. Ultimately, enjoying veal responsibly means being mindful of the animals' welfare and choosing products from sustainable and ethical sources."

    "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in food production animals.\tUntil recently, reports on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in food production animals were mainly limited to occasional detections in dairy cattle mastitis. However, since 2005 a MRSA clone, CC398, has been reported colonizing pigs, veal calves and broiler chickens and infecting dairy cows. Many aspects of its prevalence in pigs remain unclear. In other livestock, colonizing capacity and reservoir status still require elucidation. MRSA CC398 has also been detected in meat, but, as for other MRSA, the risk this poses is somewhat unclear.

    "Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers, hexachlorobenzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in various foodstuffs before and after coo...\tThe cooking-induced changes in the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in various foodstuffs were investigated. Foods included fish (sardine, hake and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, boiled) samples were analyzed. There were some variations in the concentrations",
