METHODS: Breast cancer patients between 50 and 75 years old were identified from state-wide tumor registries in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire; controls were randomly selected from drivers' license lists (age less than 65) or Medicare enrollment",
    "The association between allergies and cancer: what is currently known?\tOBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of what is currently known about the relationship between allergies and cancer. DATA SOURCES: Publications were selected from a systematic review of the English-language literature from established databases (eg, MEDLINE, EBSCO) and the references of materials identified through these databases. STUDY SELECTION: Publications assessing the association between asthma, hay fever, or other allergy-related diseases and cancer were included in this review. RESULTS: Individuals with any type of allergy have a decreased risk for cancer (compared with the general population), including glioma, colorectal cancer, cancer of the larynx,",
    "Therapeutic efficacy of once-daily oral administration of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, bikunin, in a mouse model and in human cancer.\tBACKGROUND: Bikunin, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, specifically inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis. METHODS: The authors initially evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of once-daily oral administration of different doses of bikunin against human ovarian carcinoma HRA cells growing in the peritonea of nude mice. For the in vivo studies, female 7-week-old nude mice were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: bikunin-treated groups (n = 9 in each group) received 3, 10, or 30 microg/g body weight per day",
    "Combined Impact of Health Behaviours and Mortality in Men and Women: The EPIC-Norfolk Prospective Population Study\tBackground There is overwhelming evidence that behavioural factors influence health, but their combined impact on the general population is less well documented. We aimed to quantify the potential combined impact of four health behaviours on mortality in men and women living in the general community. Methods and Findings We examined the prospective relationship between lifestyle and mortality in a prospective population study of 20,244 men and women aged 45\u201379 y with no known cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline survey in 1993\u20131997, living in the general community in the United Kingdom, and followed up to 2006. Participants scored one point for each",
