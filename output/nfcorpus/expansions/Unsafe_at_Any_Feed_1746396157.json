    "\"Unsafe at Any Feed\" is a play on the title of Ralph Nader's book \"Unsafe at Any Speed,\" which addressed safety concerns in the automotive industry. In a similar vein, \"Unsafe at Any Feed\" could refer to potential dangers or risks associated with the food industry. This could encompass issues such as food contamination, improper labeling, deceptive marketing practices, and the overall quality and safety of food products. Just as with the automotive industry, ensuring consumer safety and holding companies accountable for their products is crucial in the food industry to protect public health and well-being.",
    "\"Unsafe at Any Feed\" refers to the potential dangers associated with providing poor quality or contaminated food to animals.

    "Unsafe at Any Feed There have been some controversial suggestions that excessive sugar may play an important role in certain degenerative diseases. Artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. One-third of the respondents who prepared meals reported unsafe food hygiene practices: e.g., they did not wash hands or take precautions to prevent cross-contamination from raw meat. Unsafe practices were reported more often by men, adults 18 to 29 years of age, and occasional food preparers. The evidence demonstrates that work schedules have a profound effect on providers' sleep and performance, as well as on their safety and that of their patients. Nurses working shifts greater than 12.5 hours are at significantly increased risk of experiencing decreased vigilance on the job, suffering an occupational injury, or making a medical error.",

    "Sugar substitutes: Health controversy over perceived benefits\tSugar is an inseparable part of the food we consume. But too much sugar is not ideal for our teeth and waistline. There have been some controversial suggestions that excessive sugar may play an important role in certain degenerative diseases. So artificial sweeteners or artificially sweetened products continue to attract consumers. A sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. Some kind of health related side effects including carcinogenicity are",
    "Consumer knowledge of foodborne microbial hazards and food-handling practices.\tA national telephone survey was conducted of 1,620 randomly selected U.S. residents who spoke English, were at least 18 years old, and resided in households with kitchen facilities. Respondents were interviewed about their recognition of foodborne pathogens, foods at risk for transmitting infection, knowledge of safe food handling, and food-handling practices. One-third of the respondents who prepared meals reported unsafe food hygiene practices: e.g., they did not wash hands or take precautions to prevent cross-contamination from raw meat. Unsafe practices were reported more often by men, adults 18 to 29 years of age, and occasional food preparers",
    "Do breast-feeding and delayed introduction of solid foods protect against subsequent obesity?\tTo correct methodologic flaws (Type II error, confounding variables, and nonblinding) in previous studies relating infant feeding to later obesity, we conducted case-control studies of 639 patients 12 to 18 years of age attending our Adolescent Clinic, and 533 similarly aged healthy children attending a Montreal high school. Each subject was classified as either obese, overweight, or nonobese based on measurements of height, weight, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Feeding history, family history, and demographic data were later ascertained \"blindly\" by telephone interview. Analysis of the raw data revealed a significantly elevated estimated",
    "PCDD and PCDF contamination in catfish feed from Arkansas, USA.\tOne combined catfish feed sample from Arkansas, USA, and its eight ingredients were analyzed for PCDDs and PCDFs. One of the ingredients, soybean meal, was highly contaminated by PCDDs, especially the toxic 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners, e.g., 7.3 pg/g dry weight or 370 pg/g lipid for the 2,3,7,8-tetra CDD. The I-TEQ value for the soybean meal was 11.4 pg/g dry weight or 576 pg/g fat. The corresponding values for the combined catfish feed concentrations were approximately 3 times lower. The congener pattern, the congener profile and the ratio sigma PCDDs/",
    "Aggressiveness and brain amine concentration in dominant and subordinate finishing pigs fed the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist ractopamine.\tUnder farm conditions, aggression related to the formation of social hierarchy and competition for resources can be a major problem because of associated injuries, social stress, and carcass losses. Any factor that may affect the regulation and amount of aggression within a farmed system, for instance, feeding the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist ractopamine (RAC), is therefore worthy of investigation. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of the widely used swine feed additive RAC, considering also the effects of sex and social rank on aggressiveness and concentrations of brain amines, neurotransmitters essential for",
    "Effects of health care provider work hours and sleep deprivation on safety and performance.\tBACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the impact of resident-physician and nurse work hours on patient safety. The evidence demonstrates that work schedules have a profound effect on providers' sleep and performance, as well as on their safety and that of their patients. Nurses working shifts greater than 12.5 hours are at significantly increased risk of experiencing decreased vigilance on the job, suffering an occupational injury, or making a medical error. Physicians-in-training working traditional > 24-hour on-call shifts are at greatly increased risk of experiencing an occupational sharps injury or a motor vehicle",
    "Cherries and health: a review.\tCherries, and in particular sweet cherries, are a nutritionally dense food rich in anthocyanins, quercetin, hydroxycinnamates, potassium, fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and melatonin. UV concentration, degree of ripeness, postharvest storage conditions, and processing, each can significantly alter the amounts of nutrients and bioactive components. These constituent nutrients and bioactive food components support the potential preventive health benefits of cherry intake in relation to cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, cherries exhibit relatively high antioxidant activity, low glycemic response, COX 1 and 2 enzyme inhibition, and other anti-carcinogenic effects in",
    "Cadmium in organic and conventional pig production.\tThe main sources of cadmium (Cd) input to soils have been phosphate fertilizers and deposition from air. In organic farming, phosphate fertilizers are not used, which may in the long term result in lower Cd levels. In the present study, feed, kidney, liver, and manure from growing/finishing pigs raised conventionally and organically on the same farm were microwave-digested and analyzed for Cd by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Cd was also analyzed in soil and water. A quality control program was included. The organic pigs (n = 40) were raised outdoors and fed an organic feed; the conventional pigs",
    "Effects of very-low-carbohydrate (horsemeat- or beef-based) diets and restricted feeding on weight gain, feed and energy efficiency, as well as ser...\tBACKGROUND/AIMS: The beneficial or harmful effect of the low-carbohydrate (low-carb), high-protein, high-fat diet (Atkins diet) has not been clearly demonstrated. We determined the effect of a low-carb diet and restricted feeding (70% ad libitum intake) on serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, ketone bodies and insulin in rats. METHODS: In experiment 1, each of 4 groups with 10 adult rats was assigned to a high-",
    "Use of statistics to assess the global burden of breast cancer.\tA variety of statistics are used to quantify the burden (occurrence and outcome) of cancer generally and of breast cancer specifically. When undertaking any cancer control program, understanding these statistics, their source, and their quality is important for assessing the current situation, allocating resources to different control strategies, and evaluating progress. Two core statistics are the cancer incidence rate and the cancer mortality rate, which provide estimates of the average risk of acquiring and of dying from the disease, respectively. About 16% of the world's population is covered by registration systems that produce cancer incidence statistics, while mortality data are"
