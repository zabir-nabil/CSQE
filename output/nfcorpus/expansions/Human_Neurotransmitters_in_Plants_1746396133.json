    "While humans have a complex system of neurotransmitters that allow for communication within the brain and nervous system, plants do not have a centralized nervous system like animals. However, plants do produce and use chemicals called phytochemicals that can act as signaling molecules within their own systems. These phytochemicals may play a role in various plant processes such as growth, defense mechanisms, and responses to environmental factors. Although the functions of these phytochemicals in plants are different from human neurotransmitters, they do serve as essential tools for communication and regulation within the plant kingdom.",
    "While humans have a complex nervous system that relies on neurotransmitters to transmit signals between neurons, plants do not have neurons or a central nervous system like animals do. However, plants do produce and use chemicals that can act as signaling molecules in a similar way to neurotransmitters in animals. These plant \"neurotransmitters\" are involved in various physiological processes such as growth, stress responses, and signal transduction. For example, plant hormones like auxins, gibberellins, and ethylene play crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development by transmitting signals between different parts of the plant. Additionally, compounds like jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are involved in plant defense responses against herbivores and pathogens, acting as communication molecules within the plant. While the functions of these plant signaling molecules are not exactly like neurotransmitters in animals, they serve important roles in coordinating plant responses to environmental cues and internal signals."

    "Human Neurotransmitters in Plants Application of LC and LC-MS to the analysis of melatonin and serotonin in edible plants. These two indoleamines have recently been reported to have widespread occurrence in many edible plants. Consuming foodstuffs containing melatonin and serotonin could raise their physiologic concentrations in blood and enhance human health. Biogenic monoamines such as serotonin, tryptamine, and tyramine function as neurotransmitters and mitogenic factors in animals and are involved in flowering, morphogenesis, and protection from and adaptation to environmental changes in plants.

    "Primum Non Nocere: An Evolutionary Analysis of Whether Antidepressants Do More Harm than Good\tAntidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin \u2013 an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals, and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health",
    "Direct and indirect cellular effects of aspartame on the brain.\tThe use of the artificial sweetener, aspartame, has long been contemplated and studied by various researchers, and people are concerned about its negative effects. Aspartame is composed of phenylalanine (50%), aspartic acid (40%) and methanol (10%). Phenylalanine plays an important role in neurotransmitter regulation, whereas aspartic acid is also thought to play a role as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Glutamate, asparagines and glutamine are formed from their precursor, aspartic acid. Methanol, which forms 10% of the broken down product, is converted in the body to formate, which can",
    "Possible neurologic effects of aspartame, a widely used food additive.\tThe artificial sweetener aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanyl-methyl ester), is consumed, primarily in beverages, by a very large number of Americans, causing significant elevations in plasma and, probably, brain phenylalanine levels. Anecdotal reports suggest that some people suffer neurologic or behavioral reactions in association with aspartame consumption. Since phenylalanine can be neurotoxic and can affect the synthesis of inhibitory monoamine neurotransmitters, the phenylalanine in aspartame could conceiveably mediate neurologic effects. If mice are given aspartame in doses that elevate plasma phenylalanine levels more than those of tyrosine (which probably occurs after any aspartame dose in humans)",
    "From beans to berries and beyond: teamwork between plant chemicals for protection of optimal human health.\tIt is now well known to consumers around the world that certain fruits and vegetables can help prevent or treat chronic human diseases. But, what many people don't fully appreciate is that it is not a single component in these plant-derived foods, but rather complex mixtures of interacting natural chemicals, that produce such powerful health-protective effects. These natural components accumulate simultaneously together in a plant, and provide a multifaceted defensive strategy for both the plant, and the human consumer. In order to investigate the strength of natural chemical cooperation in highly-pigmented, flavonoid-",
    "The Garden of Eden--plant based diets, the genetic drive to conserve cholesterol and its implications for heart disease in the 21st century.\tIt is likely that plant food consumption throughout much of human evolution shaped the dietary requirements of contemporary humans. Diets would have been high in dietary fiber, vegetable protein, plant sterols and associated phytochemicals, and low in saturated and trans-fatty acids and other substrates for cholesterol biosynthesis. To meet the body's needs for cholesterol, we believe genetic differences and polymorphisms were conserved by evolution, which tended to raise serum cholesterol levels. As a result modern man, with a radically different diet and lifestyle, especially in middle age,",

    "A literature review on the safety assessment of genetically modified plants.\tIn recent years, there has been a notable concern on the safety of genetically modified (GM) foods/plants, an important and complex area of research, which demands rigorous standards. Diverse groups including consumers and environmental Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) have suggested that all GM foods/plants should be subjected to long-term animal feeding studies before approval for human consumption. In 2000 and 2006, we reviewed the information published in international scientific journals, noting that the number of references concerning human and animal toxicological/health risks studies on GM foods/plants was very limited.

    "Evolution of dietary antioxidants.\tOxygen is vital for most organisms but, paradoxically, damages key biological sites. Oxygenic threat is met by antioxidants that evolved in parallel with our oxygenic atmosphere. Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against reactive oxygen species (ROS; oxidants) produced during photosynthesis. The human body is exposed to these same oxidants, and we have also evolved an effective antioxidant system. However, this is not infallible. ROS breach defences, oxidative damage ensues, accumulates with age, and causes a variety of pathological changes. Plant-based, antioxidant-rich foods traditionally formed the major part of the human diet, and plant-based dietary antioxidants are"
