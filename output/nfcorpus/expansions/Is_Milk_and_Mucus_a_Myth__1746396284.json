    "The belief that consuming milk causes mucus production is a widely debated topic. Some people claim that dairy products such as milk can thicken mucus and worsen symptoms of common colds or respiratory conditions. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this idea. Studies have shown mixed results, with some suggesting a possible link between dairy consumption and increased mucus production, while others have found no significant correlation.\n\nIt is important to note that individual reactions to dairy products can vary, and some people may experience increased mucus production after consuming milk or other dairy foods. These individuals may benefit from reducing or eliminating dairy from their diet to see if it helps alleviate their symptoms.\n\nUltimately, whether or not milk and mucus are directly connected remains inconclusive and can vary from person to person. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice on diet and nutrition to address any concerns related to mucus production.",
    "The belief that milk increases mucus production in the body is a commonly held myth. While some individuals may perceive an increase in mucus after consuming milk or dairy products, scientific research does not support a direct causal relationship between dairy consumption and mucus production. Studies have shown that any perception of increased mucus is likely due to the texture of milk rather than an actual physiological response. Additionally, individuals with lactose intolerance or specific allergies to dairy may experience symptoms such as congestion or a runny nose after consuming milk, but this is not indicative of increased mucus production overall. Overall, the idea that milk and mucus are linked is more of a misconception than a scientifically supported fact."

    "Is milk and mucus a myth? Does milk increase mucus production? Excessive milk consumption has a long association with increased respiratory tract mucus production and asthma. In the human colon, beta-casomorphin-7 (beta-CM-7), an exorphin derived from the breakdown of A1 milk, stimulates mucus production from gut MUC5AC glands. Mean faecal urobilinogen levels and the pH of stools were both found to be higher in subjects from a population group at high risk of developing cancer of the colon than in subjects matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status from a low-risk population group. An alkaline reaction of the colon contents seems to have a tumorigenic effect by a direct action on the mucus of the mucous cells. Chronic constipation in children can be caused by cows' milk intolerance (CMI). A total of 14 patients were found to be suffering from CMI...whereas constipation recurred on food challenge.",

    "Does milk increase mucus production?\tExcessive milk consumption has a long association with increased respiratory tract mucus production and asthma. Such an association cannot be explained using a conventional allergic paradigm and there is limited medical evidence showing causality. In the human colon, beta-casomorphin-7 (beta-CM-7), an exorphin derived from the breakdown of A1 milk, stimulates mucus production from gut MUC5AC glands. In the presence of inflammation similar mucus overproduction from respiratory tract MUC5AC glands characterises many respiratory tract diseases. beta-CM-7 from the blood stream could stimulate the production and secretion of mucus production from these respiratory glands. Such a hypothesis could be tested in vitro using quantitative RT-",
    "Faecal urobilinogen levels and pH of stools in population groups with different incidence of cancer of the colon, and their possible role in its aetiology.\tMean faecal urobilinogen levels and the pH of stools were both found to be higher in subjects from a population group at high risk of developing cancer of the colon than in subjects matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status from a low-risk population group. An alkaline reaction of the colon contents seems to have a tumorigenic effect by a direct action on the mucus of the mucous cells. An acidic reaction, on the other hand, appears to be protective. These differences are dependent on the patterns of diet and manner of",
    "Myths, Presumptions, and Facts about Obesity\tBACKGROUND Many beliefs about obesity persist in the absence of supporting scientific evidence (presumptions); some persist despite contradicting evidence (myths). The promulgation of unsupported beliefs may yield poorly informed policy decisions, inaccurate clinical and public health recommendations, and an unproductive allocation of research resources and may divert attention away from useful, evidence-based information. METHODS Using Internet searches of popular media and scientific literature, we identified, reviewed, and classified obesity-related myths and presumptions. We also examined facts that are well supported by evidence, with an emphasis on those that have practical implications for public health, policy, or clinical recommendations",
    "Food intolerance and chronic constipation: manometry and histology study.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic constipation in children can be caused by cows' milk intolerance (CMI), but its pathogenesis is unknown. AIMS: To evaluate the histology and manometry pattern in patients with food intolerance-related constipation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive children with chronic constipation were enrolled. All underwent an elimination diet and successive double-blind food challenge. All underwent rectal biopsy and anorectal manometry. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients were found to be suffering from CMI and three from multiple food intolerance. They had a normal stool frequency on elimination diet, whereas constipation recurred on food challenge.",
    "Monosodium glutamate 'allergy': menace or myth?\tMonosodium glutamate (MSG) is a salt form of a non-essential amino acid commonly used as a food additive for its unique flavour enhancing qualities. Since the first description of the 'Monosodium glutamate symptom complex', originally described in 1968 as the 'Chinese restaurant syndrome', a number of anecdotal reports and small clinical studies of variable quality have attributed a variety of symptoms to the dietary ingestion of MSG. Descriptions of MSG-induced asthma, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis have prompted some to suggest that MSG should be an aetiologic consideration in patients presenting with these conditions. This review prevents a",
    "Longevity and diet. Myth or pragmatism?\tLongevity is a very complex phenomenon, because many environmental, behavioral, socio-demographic and dietary factors influence the physiological pathways of aging and life-expectancy. Nutrition has been recognized to have an important impact on overall mortality and morbidity; and its role in extending life expectancy has been the object of extensive scientific research. This paper reviews the pathophysiological mechanisms that potentially link aging with diet and the scientific evidence supporting the anti-aging effect of the traditional Mediterranean diet, as well as of some specific foods. The diet and several of its components have additionally been shown to have beneficial effects on the co-morbidities typical of",
    "Presence and Characterization of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli and Other Potentially Diarrheagenic E. coli Strains in Retail Meats\tTo determine the presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other potentially diarrheagenic E. coli strains in retail meats, 7,258 E. coli isolates collected by the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) retail meat program from 2002 to 2007 were screened for Shiga toxin genes. In addition, 1,275 of the E. coli isolates recovered in 2006 were examined for virulence genes specific for other diarrheagenic E. coli strains. Seventeen isolates (16 from ground beef and 1 from a pork chop) were positive for stx genes, including 5 positive for both stx1 and",
    "Peppermint oil (Mintoil) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial.\tINTRODUCTION: The use of peppermint oil in treating the irritable bowel syndrome has been studied with variable results probably due to the presence of patients affected by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance or celiac disease that may have symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome. AIM: The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of enteric-coated peppermint oil in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in whom small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance and celiac disease were excluded. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with irritable bowel syndrome according to the Rome II criteria,",
    "Effect of two types of soy milk and dairy milk on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic adults: a randomized trial.\tOBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of two commercially available soy milks (one made using whole soy beans, the other using soy protein isolate) with low-fat dairy milk on plasma lipid, insulin, and glucose responses. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial, cross-over design. SUBJECTS: Participants were 30-65 years of age, n = 28, with pre-study LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations of 160-220 mg/dL, not on lipid lowering medications, and with an overall Framingham risk score of <or=10",
    "Prevalence and public health significance of aluminum residues in milk and some dairy products.\tSixty random samples of bulk farm milk, market milk, locally manufactured processed cheese, and milk powder were collected to be analyzed for aluminum (Al) concentration using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The results were compared with provisional acceptable permissible limits (PAPLs). The maximum estimated dietary intake (MEDI) of Al for the examined samples was calculated. In addition, an experimental study was conducted to determine the possible leaching of Al from cookware in milk during boiling. The obtained results showed that Al concentration in examined bulk farm milk samples was found to be negligible. In"
