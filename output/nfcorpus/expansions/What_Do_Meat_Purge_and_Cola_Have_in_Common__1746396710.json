    "Meat purge and cola both involve a process of separation and release. In the case of meat purge, this refers to the natural occurrence of liquid seeping out of meat, often during storage or cooking. Similarly, cola experiences a separation process as well, with carbonation rising to the surface when the drink is opened or poured. Both meat purge and cola demonstrate a tendency for elements to separate or release under certain conditions, highlighting the dynamic nature of these substances.",
    "Meat purge and cola have one interesting similarity - both can potentially leave behind residue or liquid. Meat purge refers to the liquid that is released from raw meat during storage or cooking, while cola is a carbonated beverage that can leave behind sticky residue when spilled. Despite their different origins and uses, both meat purge and cola highlight the aspect of fluid release or residue formation. It is important to handle both with care to prevent any mess or waste."

    "What Do Meat Purge and Cola Have in Common? Low-pH cola beverages do not affect women's iron absorption from a vegetarian meal. A randomized, crossover trial was conducted to compare the bioavailability of nonheme iron from a vegetarian pizza meal when consumed with 3 different beverages (cola, diet cola, and mineral water). We have examined the association between intake frequency of various types of soft drinks and the concentration of serum triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. A total of 14,188 subjects of the altogether 18,770 participants of the study had data on intake frequency of colas and non-colas, with or without sugar. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of various types of Coca-cola intake with different composition for 6 months on oxidative status in testes and testosterone in adult male rats. Fifty adult male Wistar rats were divided into control group drinking water, and groups drinking different Coca-cola beverages (regular Coca-cola, Coca-cola caffeine-free, Coca-cola Light and Coca-cola Zero).",

    "Vegetarian diets: what do we know of their effects on common chronic diseases?\tA number of studies have evaluated the health of vegetarians. Others have studied the health effects of foods that are preferred or avoided by vegetarians. The purpose of this review is to look critically at the evidence on the health effects of vegetarian diets and to seek possible explanations where results appear to conflict. There is convincing evidence that vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease, largely explained by low LDL cholesterol, probable lower rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower prevalence of obesity. Overall, their cancer rates appear to be moderately lower than others living in the same communities, and",
    "Low-pH cola beverages do not affect women's iron absorption from a vegetarian meal.\tPreliminary data in the literature indicate that iron absorption from a meal may be increased when consumed with low-pH beverages such as cola, and it is also possible that sugar iron complexes may alter iron availability. A randomized, crossover trial was conducted to compare the bioavailability of nonheme iron from a vegetarian pizza meal when consumed with 3 different beverages (cola, diet cola, and mineral water). Sixteen women with serum ferritin concentrations of 11-54 \u00b5g/L were recruited and completed the study. The pizza meal contained native iron and added ferric chloride solution as a stable",
    "Combined Impact of Health Behaviours and Mortality in Men and Women: The EPIC-Norfolk Prospective Population Study\tBackground There is overwhelming evidence that behavioural factors influence health, but their combined impact on the general population is less well documented. We aimed to quantify the potential combined impact of four health behaviours on mortality in men and women living in the general community. Methods and Findings We examined the prospective relationship between lifestyle and mortality in a prospective population study of 20,244 men and women aged 45\u201379 y with no known cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline survey in 1993\u20131997, living in the general community in the United Kingdom, and followed up to 2006. Participants scored one point for each",
    "Cola intake and serum lipids in the Oslo Health Study.\tSoft drinks can be a major source of sucrose, which may influence serum lipid concentration. We have examined the association between intake frequency of various types of soft drinks and the concentration of serum triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the cross-sectional Oslo Health Study. A total of 14 188 subjects of the altogether 18,770 participants of the study had data on intake frequency of colas and non-colas, with or without sugar. The population sample consisted of both sexes and 3 age groups: group 1 (30 years of age",
    "Fructose: It\u2019s \u201cAlcohol Without the Buzz\u201d\tWhat do the Atkins Diet and the traditional Japanese diet have in common? The Atkins Diet is low in carbohydrate and usually high in fat; the Japanese diet is high in carbohydrate and usually low in fat. Yet both work to promote weight loss. One commonality of both diets is that they both eliminate the monosaccharide fructose. Sucrose (table sugar) and its synthetic sister high fructose corn syrup consist of 2 molecules, glucose and fructose. Glucose is the molecule that when polymerized forms starch, which has a high glycemic index, generates an insulin response, and is not particularly sweet. Fructose is found in fruit",
    "Fibromyalgia and nutrition, what do we know?\tMany people suffer from fibromyalgia (FM) without an effective treatment. They do not have a good quality of life and cannot maintain normal daily activity. Among the different hypotheses for its ethiopathophysiology, oxidative stress is one of the possibilities. Non-scientific information addressed to patients regarding the benefits of nutrition is widely available, and they are used to trying non-evidenced strategies. The aim of this paper is to find out what we know right now from scientific studies regarding fibromyalgia disease and nutritional status, diets and food supplements. A systematic search has been performed on Medline with a wide range of terms about these",
    "Meat and fish consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.\tPancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide with large geographical variation, which implies the contribution of diet and lifestyle in its etiology. We examined the association of meat and fish consumption with risk of pancreatic cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). A total of 477,202 EPIC participants from 10 European countries recruited between 1992 and 2000 were included in our analysis. Until 2008, 865 nonendocrine pancreatic cancer cases have been observed. Calibrated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using",
    "Do phytoestrogens reduce the risk of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence? What clinicians need to know.\tOestrogen is an important determinant of breast cancer risk. Oestrogen-mimicking plant compounds called phytoestrogens can bind to oestrogen receptors and exert weak oestrogenic effects. Despite this activity, epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of breast cancer is lower in countries where the intake of phytoestrogens is high, implying that these compounds may reduce breast cancer risk, and possibly have an impact on survival. Isoflavones and lignans are the most common phytoestrogens in the diet. In this article, we present findings from human observational and intervention studies related to both isoflavone and lignan exposure and breast cancer risk and",
    "Mediterranean diet and public health: personal reflections.\tMy concern about diet as a public health problem began in the early 1950s in Naples, where we observed very low incidences of coronary heart disease associated with what we later came to call the \"good Mediterranean diet.\" The heart of this diet is mainly vegetarian, and differs from American and northern European diets in that it is much lower in meat and dairy products and uses fruit for dessert. These observations led to our subsequent research in the Seven Countries Study, in which we demonstrated that saturated fat is the major dietary villain. Today, the healthy Mediterranean diet is changing and coronary heart disease is no longer confined",
    "No harmful effect of different Coca-cola beverages after 6 months of intake on rat testes.\tOur laboratory recently reported that a 3-month exposure of rats to cola-like beverages induced sex hormone changes. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of various types of Coca-cola intake with different composition for 6 months on oxidative status in testes and testosterone in adult male rats.
