    "Coffee consumption has been studied extensively in relation to its effects on artery function. Research has shown that the compounds present in coffee, such as caffeine and antioxidants, may have both positive and negative impacts on artery health. Some studies suggest that moderate coffee consumption can improve artery function by increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation. However, excessive coffee intake or consuming coffee with added sugars and creamers may have detrimental effects on artery function by causing oxidative stress and raising blood pressure. It is important to enjoy coffee in moderation and be mindful of the overall impact on artery health when including it in the diet.",
    "Numerous studies have researched the impact of coffee consumption on artery function. Coffee contains compounds that may have both positive and negative effects on the cardiovascular system. Some studies suggest that moderate coffee intake may have a beneficial effect on artery function by improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. However, excessive coffee consumption, especially in individuals sensitive to caffeine, may lead to temporary increases in blood pressure and arterial stiffness. It is important for individuals to be mindful of their coffee intake and consider factors like their overall health and caffeine sensitivity when consuming coffee regularly. Consulting with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on coffee consumption and its effects on artery function is recommended."

    "Coffee and endothelial function: a battle between caffeine and antioxidants?\tAlthough coffee is largely consumed by adults in Western countries, controversy exists about its impact on the cardiovascular system. We recently demonstrated that caffeinated and decaffeinated espresso coffee have different acute effects on endothelial function in healthy subjects, measured using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. In this study, we measured the anti-oxidant capacity of two coffee substances in terms of free stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl 50% inhibition (I(50) DPPH). The caffeinated coffee had a slightly higher anti-oxidant capacity than decaffeinated espresso coffee (I(50) DPPH: 1.13\u00b10.02 vs 1.30\u00b10.03",
    "Effect of coffee on endothelial function in healthy subjects: the role of caffeine.\tCoffee is one of the most widely used pharmacologically active beverages. The present study was designed to evaluate the acute effect of coffee ingestion on endothelial function in healthy individuals, and the potential role of caffeine. We studied 17 healthy young adults (28.9+/-3.0 years old; nine men), who were regular non-heavy coffee drinkers. The endothelial performance was estimated by endothelium-dependent FMD (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingestion of a cup of caffeinated coffee (80 mg of caffeine) or the corresponding decaffeinated beverage",
    "Dose-dependent effects of decaffeinated coffee on endothelial function in healthy subjects.\tBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Coffee is known to contain antioxidant substances whose effects may be blunted because of caffeine that may unfavorably affect the cardiovascular system. This study was designed to investigate the acute dose-dependent effects of decaffeinated coffee (DC) on endothelial function measured by the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 15 (8 men and 7 women) healthy nonobese subjects underwent a single-blind, crossover study. Subjects ingested one and two cups of decaffeinated Italian espresso coffee in random order at 5- to 7-day intervals. RESULTS: In",
    "Acute effects of coffee on endothelial function in healthy subjects.\tBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Coffee is the most widely consumed beverage in the world, but its effect on the cardiovascular system has not been fully understood. Coffee contains caffeine and antioxidants, which may influence endothelial function, both of which have not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the acute effects of coffee on endothelial function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 20 (10 males and 10 females) healthy non-obese subjects underwent a double-blind, crossover study. Subjects ingested one cup of caffeinated (CC) and",
    "Impact of acute caffeine ingestion on endothelial function in subjects with and without coronary artery disease.\tAlthough coffee is a widely used, pharmacologically active beverage, its impact on the cardiovascular system is controversial. To explore the effect of acute caffeine ingestion on brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in subjects without coronary artery disease (CAD; controls) and patients with CAD, we prospectively assessed brachial artery FMD in 40 controls and 40 age- and gender-matched patients with documented stable CAD on 2 separate mornings 1 week to 2 weeks apart. After overnight fasting, discontinuation of all medications for \u226512 hours, and absence of caffeine for >48 hours, participants received capsules",
    "Consumption of a boiled Greek type of coffee is associated with improved endothelial function: the Ikaria study.\tOBJECTIVE: The association of coffee consumption with cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Endothelial function is associated with cardiovascular risk. We examined the association between chronic coffee consumption and endothelium function in elderly inhabitants of the island of Ikaria. METHODS: The analysis was conducted on 142 elderly subjects (aged 66-91 years) of the Ikaria Study. Endothelial function was evaluated by ultrasound measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Coffee consumption was evaluated based on a food frequency questionnaire and was categorized as 'low' (< 200 ml/day), 'moderate' (",
    "Effects of acute administration of caffeine on vascular function.\tCaffeine is the most widely used pharmacologic substance in the world. It is found in common nonessential grocery items (e.g., coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate). The effects of caffeine on cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, remain controversial, and there is little information on its direct effect on vascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of caffeine on endothelial function in humans. This study was a double-blind, randomized placebo and active drug study. Forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine (ACh), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and to sodium nitroprusside,",
    "Caffeine enhances endothelial repair by an AMPK-dependent mechanism.\tOBJECTIVE: Migratory capacity of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mature endothelial cells (ECs) is a key prerequisite for endothelial repair after denuding injury or endothelial damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate that caffeine in physiologically relevant concentrations (50 to 100 micromol/L) induces migration of human EPCs as well as mature ECs. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), caffeinated coffee increased caffeine serum concentration from 2 micromol/L to 23 micromol/L, coinciding with a significant increase in migratory activity of patient-derived EPCs. Decaffeinated coffee neither affected caffeine serum levels nor migratory capacity of EPCs",
    "Arterial function of carotid and brachial arteries in postmenopausal vegetarians\tBackground: Vegetarianism is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies of arterial function in vegetarians are limited. Methods: This study investigated arterial function in vegetarianism by comparing 49 healthy postmenopausal vegetarians with 41 age-matched omnivores. The arterial function of the common carotid artery was assessed by carotid duplex, while the pulse dynamics method was used to measure brachial artery distensibility (BAD), compliance (BAC), and resistance (BAR). Fasting blood levels of glucose, lipids, lipoprotein (a), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 were also measured.",
    "Coffee and its consumption: benefits and risks.\tCoffee is the leading worldwide beverage after water and its trade exceeds US $10 billion worldwide. Controversies regarding its benefits and risks still exist as reliable evidence is becoming available supporting its health promoting potential; however, some researchers have argued about the association of coffee consumption with cardiovascular complications and cancer insurgence. The health-promoting properties of coffee are often attributed to its rich phytochemistry, including caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ), etc. Many research investigations, epidemiological studies, and meta-analyses regarding coffee consumption revealed its inverse correlation with that of diabetes mellitus, various cancer lines, Parkinsonism,"
