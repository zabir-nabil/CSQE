    "Milk is often touted as being good for our bones due to its high calcium content. Calcium is a crucial mineral that is essential for maintaining bone health and density. Our bones need a constant supply of calcium to stay strong and prevent conditions like osteoporosis. Milk is a convenient and easily accessible source of calcium, making it a popular choice for many people looking to support their bone health.\n\nIn addition to calcium, milk also provides other nutrients such as vitamin D, which plays a role in calcium absorption. These nutrients work together to support bone health and overall skeletal strength. However, it's important to note that there are other sources of calcium and nutrients that can also benefit our bones, such as leafy greens, nuts, and fortified foods.\n\nWhile milk can be a beneficial addition to a balanced diet for supporting bone health, it's not the only option available. It's essential to consume a diverse range of foods to ensure you're getting all the necessary nutrients for strong and healthy bones. Additionally, individual dietary needs and preferences should be taken into account when considering the role of milk in maintaining bone health.",
    "Milk is commonly known for being a good source of calcium, a mineral essential for building and maintaining strong bones. Adequate calcium intake is crucial for bone health, especially during childhood and adolescence when bones are still developing. Calcium not only helps to form and maintain bone structure but also plays a key role in muscle function and nerve transmission.\n\nIn addition to calcium, milk also contains other important nutrients like vitamin D and protein, which are also beneficial for bone health. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, while protein is necessary for overall bone maintenance and repair.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that milk may not be suitable for everyone due to lactose intolerance or other dietary preferences. In such cases, there are various alternative sources of calcium and other nutrients that can support bone health, including fortified plant-based milk, leafy green vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\n\nIn conclusion, milk can be a beneficial part of a balanced diet for those who can tolerate it, providing essential nutrients that contribute to overall bone health. It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the best dietary choices for individual needs and preferences."

    "Milk intake and risk of hip fracture in men and women: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\tMilk contains calcium, phosphorus, and protein and is fortified with vitamin D in the United States. All these ingredients may improve bone health. However, the potential benefit of milk on hip fracture prevention is not well established. The objective of this study was to assess the association of milk intake with risk of hip fracture based on a meta-analysis of cohort studies in middle-aged or older men and women. Data sources for this study were English and non-English publications via Medline (Ovid, PubMed) and EMBASE search up to June 2010",
    "Mechanisms of breast cancer bone metastasis.\tBone, as well as liver and lung, is one of the most preferential metastatic target sites for cancers including breast, prostate, and lung cancers and the consequences are always devastating. Like other metastasis, breast cancer bone metastasis consists of several steps from the escape of primary site to the colonization in target site. This review focuses on several key steps including: 1. Invasion and escape from primary tumor site. 2. Target migration toward bone. 3. Specific adhesion and arrest in bone. 4. Establishment of metastasis in bone. The factors involved in this process will provide good targets for therapy. Copyright (c)",
    "Dietary protein and bone health: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\tBACKGROUND: There has been a resurgence of interest in the controversial relation between dietary protein and bone health. OBJECTIVE: This article reports on the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the relation between protein and bone health in healthy human adults. DESIGN: The MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to July 2008) databases were electronically searched for all relevant studies of healthy adults; studies of calcium excretion or calcium balance were excluded. RESULTS: In cross-sectional surveys, all pooled r values for the relation between protein intake and bone mineral density (BMD)",
    "Antioxidant status in humans after consumption of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) juices with and without defatted milk.\tThe present study was designed to evaluate the possible effect of the consumption of blackberry juices (BJ) prepared with water (BJW) and defatted milk (BJM) on the plasma antioxidant capacity and the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. A significant (p < 0.05) increase in the ascorbic acid content in the plasma was observed after intake of both BJs. However, no changes were observed in the plasma urate and alpha-tocopherol levels. An increase on the plasma antioxidant capacity, by ORAC assay, was observed only after consumption of BJW but not statistically significant.",
    "Milk consumption: aggravating factor of acne and promoter of chronic diseases of Western societies.\tConsumption of cow's milk and cow's milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) in humans. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence and adulthood. During puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone, IGF-1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumption. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen; after binding to its receptor in various tissues, it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Keratinocytes and sebocytes, as well as the androgen-synthesizing adrenals and gonads, are",

    "Low protein intake: the impact on calcium and bone homeostasis in humans.\tIncreasing dietary protein results in an increase in urinary calcium. Despite over 80 y of research, the source of the additional urinary calcium remains unclear. Because most calcium balance studies found little effect of dietary protein on intestinal calcium absorption, it was assumed that the skeleton was the source of the calcium. The hypothesis was that the high endogenous acid load generated by a protein-rich diet would increase bone resorption and skeletal fracture. However, there are no definitive nutrition intervention studies that show a detrimental effect of a high protein diet on the skeleton and the hypothesis remains unproven. Recent studies from our"
