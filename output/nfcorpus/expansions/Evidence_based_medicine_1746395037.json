    "Evidence-based medicine is an approach to medical practice that integrates the best available evidence from research, clinical expertise, and patient preferences. By utilizing the most current and reliable research findings alongside the practitioner's experience and the individual patient's needs and values, evidence-based medicine aims to provide the most effective and personalized care possible. This approach emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating and applying research evidence to guide clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of care. In an era of rapidly expanding medical knowledge, evidence-based medicine serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to ensure that their practice is informed by the most up-to-date and trustworthy evidence available.",
    "Evidence-based medicine is an approach to medical practice that emphasizes using the best available evidence to inform decision-making when it comes to the care of individual patients. This approach involves integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By basing medical decisions on solid evidence rather than tradition or opinion, evidence-based medicine aims to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care provided. Practitioners of evidence-based medicine regularly review and critically appraise the latest research findings to ensure that their practices are up-to-date and in line with the most current and effective treatments. This process fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the medical field, ultimately benefiting patients by delivering care that is proven to be effective and based on the latest scientific knowledge."

    "Evidence-based medicine The current approach to evidence-based medicine encourages physicians to ignore any information that does not come from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Physicians are biased toward drug treatments and against dietary interventions for the management of chronic disease. The evidence base for prescribing statins for women, especially for primary prevention is weak. The historical context of Women's Health Movement advocates for unbiased medical research and prescribing based on evidence-based medicine. Since then, there have been randomized controlled trials and large epidemiological studies that reported associations with lower cardiovascular disease. Several reports showing that even non-Mediterranean populations can gain benefits from long-term adhesion to the Mediterranean diet. Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio.",
    "Evidence-based medicine Medical students in the United States are taught little about nutrition and dietetics. The current approach to evidence-based medicine encourages physicians to ignore any information that does not come from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. This paper is based on a longer report on the benefits, safety and modalities of information representation with regard to women and statin use, situated within the historical context of the Women's Health Movement which has advocated for unbiased, appropriate medical research and prescribing for women based on the goals of full-disclosure, informed consent, evidence-based medicine and gender-based analysis.

    "How evidence-based medicine biases physicians against nutrition.\tMedical students in the United States are taught little about nutrition and dietetics. Worse yet, their training biases them against the studies that show the power of dietary approaches to managing disease. The current approach to evidence-based medicine encourages physicians to ignore any information that does not come from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Yet human beings cannot be blinded to a dietary intervention. As a result, physicians are biased toward drug treatments and against dietary interventions for the management of chronic disease.

    "Women and statin use: a women's health advocacy perspective.\tThis paper is based on a longer report on the benefits, safety and modalities of information representation with regard to women and statin use, situated within the historical context of Women's Health Movement which has advocated for unbiased, appropriate medical research and prescribing for women based on the goals of full-disclosure, informed consent, evidence-based medicine and gender-based analysis. The evidence base for prescribing statins for women, especially for primary prevention is weak, yet Canadian data suggest that half of all prescriptions are for women. Safety meta-analyses do not disaggregate for women; do not consider female vulnerability",
    "Resident duty-hour restrictions-who are we protecting?: AOA critical issues.\tAs advocated by Nasca, our teaching programs must nurture professionalism and the effacement of self interest that is the core of the practice of medicine and the profession. The evidence to date suggests that work-hour restrictions based solely on clock-defined time limits discourage, rather than promote, the professional behavior that we desire in tomorrow's physicians. Notwithstanding any issues related to duty hours or fitness for duty, a competency-based system of medical education is both desirable and necessary in the current environment of medical education. In the absence of evidence to suggest that duty-hour limits reduce",
    "Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular disease: historical perspective and latest evidence.\tThe concept that the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was first proposed in the 1950s. Since then, there have been randomized controlled trials and large epidemiological studies that reported associations with lower CVD: in 1994 and 1999, the reports of the intermediate and final analyses of the trial Lyon Diet Heart Study; in 2003, a major epidemiological study in Greece showing a strong inverse association between a Mediterranean score and the risk of cardiovascular complications; in 2011-2012, several reports showing that even non-Mediterranean populations can gain benefits from long-term adhesion to the",
    "The emergence of \"lifestyle medicine\" as a structured approach for management of chronic disease.\tChronic diseases with a lifestyle-based aetiology currently make up a significant proportion of primary care consultations, but management often falls between the demands of public and clinical health. A modified clinical approach, based around the concept of \"lifestyle medicine\", helps fill the gap by adding behavioural, motivational and environmental skills to conventional medical practice. When used in a multidisciplinary setting, lifestyle medicine offers potential cost and effectiveness benefits, which are beginning to be realised.",
    "A Pill for the Ill? Patients\u2019 Reports of Their Experience of the Medical Encounter in the Treatment of Depression\tBackground Starting in the 1960s, a broad-based patients\u2019 rights movement began to question doctors\u2019 paternalism and to demand disclosure of medical information, informed consent, and active participation by the individual in personal health care. According to scholars, these changes contributed to downplay the biomedical approach in favor of a more patient-oriented perspective. The Swedish non-profit organization Consumer Association for Medicines and Health (KILEN) has offered the possibility for consumers to report their perceptions and experiences from their use of medicines in order to strengthen consumer rights within the health care",
    "Toxicology and risk assessment of coumarin: focus on human data.\tCoumarin is a secondary phytochemical with hepatotoxic and carcinogenic properties. For the carcinogenic effect, a genotoxic mechanism was considered possible, but was discounted by the European Food Safety Authority in 2004 based on new evidence. This allowed the derivation of a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for the first time, and a value of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was arrived at based on animal hepatotoxicity data. However, clinical data on hepatotoxicity from patients treated with coumarin as medicinal drug is also available. This data revealed a subgroup of the human population being more susceptible for the hepatotoxic effect than the animal species investigated.",
    "Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy.\tBACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials--and the outcomes within those trials--can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio. METHODS: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports",
    "Review of the efficacy of green tea, isoflavones and aloe vera supplements based on randomised controlled trials.\tWe assess the evidence for health benefits of three commonly consumed plant food supplements (PFS), green tea, isoflavone and aloe vera, based on published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Whilst the potential benefits of green tea have been reported in a wide range of health areas, it is only in the area of the metabolic syndrome that the number of RCTs is approaching sufficient to judge such efficacy. Isoflavone supplements are widely used, and RCTs indicate that they affect bone resorption at lower doses in postmenopausal women undergoing estrogen-related bone loss, but",
    "Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century\tExcerpt Second in a series of publications from the Institute of Medicine's Quality of Health Care in America project Today's health care providers have more research findings and more technology available to them than ever before. Yet recent reports have raised serious doubts about the quality of health care in America. Crossing the Quality Chasm makes an urgent call for fundamental change to close the quality gap. This book recommends a sweeping redesign of the American health care system and provides overarching principles for specific direction for policymakers, health care leaders, clinicians, regulators, purchasers, and others. In this comprehensive volume the committee offers"
