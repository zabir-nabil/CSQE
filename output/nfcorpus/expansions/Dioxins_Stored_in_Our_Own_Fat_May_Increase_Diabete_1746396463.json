    "Dioxins, toxic pollutants found in the environment, have been shown to have a potential link to an increased risk of diabetes when stored in our body fat. Research suggests that these dioxins can disrupt hormonal balance and interfere with insulin production and regulation, which are key factors in diabetes development. When dioxins accumulate in our adipose tissue, they can continue to exert harmful effects on our metabolism and overall health. Therefore, reducing exposure to dioxins through environmental measures and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to minimize fat storage may help lower the risk of diabetes associated with these toxic compounds.",
    "Researchers have found a concerning link between dioxins stored in human fat and an increased risk of diabetes. Dioxins are toxic chemicals that can accumulate in our bodies over time, particularly in fatty tissues. These chemicals are known to disrupt various bodily functions, including metabolism and insulin regulation. Studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of dioxins in their fat stores are more likely to develop diabetes. This connection highlights the importance of understanding and addressing environmental factors that can impact our health outcomes. By minimizing our exposure to harmful substances like dioxins and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, we can reduce the risk of developing conditions such as diabetes."

    "Simultaneous exposure of non-diabetics to high levels of dioxins and mercury increases their risk of insulin resistance.\tInsulin resistance and the defective function of pancreatic \u03b2-cells can occur several years before the development of type 2 diabetes. It is necessary to investigate and clarify the integrated effects of moderate-to-high exposure to dioxins and mercury on the pancreatic endocrine function. This cross-sectional study investigated 1449 non-diabetic residents near a deserted pentachlorophenol and chloralkali factory. Metabolic syndrome related factors were measured to examine associations with serum dioxin and blood mercury. We also investigated associations between insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 75th percentile), defective pancreatic \u03b2-cells function",
    "Intramyocellular triglyceride content is a determinant of in vivo insulin resistance in humans: a 1H-13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as...\tInsulin resistance is the best prediction factor for the clinical onset of type 2 diabetes. It was suggested that intramuscular triglyceride store may be a primary pathogenic factor for its development. To test this hypothesis, 14 young lean offspring of type 2 diabetic parents, a model of in vivo insulin resistance with increased risk to develop diabetes, and 14 healthy subjects matched for anthropomorphic parameters and life habits were studied with 1) euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to assess whole body insulin sensitivity, 2) localized 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the soleus (higher",
    "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from the maternal diet may be associated with immunosuppressive effects that persist int...\tWe investigated whether prenatal exposure from the maternal diet to the toxicants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins is associated with the development of immune-related diseases in childhood. Children participating in BraMat, a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), were followed in the three first years of life using annual questionnaires (0-3years; n=162, 2-3years; n=180), and blood parameters were examined at three years of age (n=114). The maternal intake of the toxicants was calculated using a validated food frequency",
    "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins is associated with increased risk of wheeze and infections in infants.\tThe birth cohort BraMat (n = 205; a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health) was established to study whether prenatal exposure to toxicants from the maternal diet affects immunological health outcomes in children. We here report on the environmental pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, as well as acrylamide generated in food during heat treatment. The frequency of common infections, eczema or itchiness, and periods of more than 10 days of dry cough, chest tightness or wheeze (called wheeze)",
    "Environmental contaminants as risk factors for developing diabetes.\tThe contribution of exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to the incidence of diabetes has received little attention until recently. A number of reports have emerged, however, concerning elevated diabetes in persons occupationally exposed to dioxin. United States (US) Air Force personnel in Vietnam who sprayed Agent Orange containing dioxin as a contaminant had elevated rates of diabetes, leading to US government compensation for diabetes in these veterans. Recent studies in populations exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides found a dose-dependent elevated risk of diabetes. An elevation in risk of diabetes in relation to levels of several POPs has been demonstrated",
    "Vegetarian and vegan diets in type 2 diabetes management.\tVegetarian and vegan diets offer significant benefits for diabetes management. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. In clinical trials in individuals with type 2 diabetes, low-fat vegan diets improve glycemic control to a greater extent than conventional diabetes diets. Although this effect is primarily attributable to greater weight loss, evidence also suggests that reduced intake of saturated fats and high-glycemic-index foods, increased intake of dietary fiber and vegetable protein, reduced intramyocellular lipid concentrations, and decreased iron stores mediate the influence of plant-based diets on glycemia",
    "Molecular Epidemiologic Evidence for Diabetogenic Effects of Dioxin Exposure in U.S. Air Force Veterans of the Vietnam War\tBackground One of the outcomes positively associated with dioxin exposure in humans is type 2 diabetes. Objectives This study was conducted in order to find the molecular biological evidence for the diabetogenic action of dioxin in adipose samples from Vietnam veterans. Methods We obtained 313 adipose tissue samples both from Vietnam veterans who were exposed to dioxin (Operation Ranch Hand) and from comparison veterans who served in Southeast Asia with no record of dioxin exposure. We conducted quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction studies on selected marker mRNAs from these samples. Results We found the most sensitive and reliable molecular indicator of",

All the papers reporting levels of these contaminants in human breast milk published from January 2000 to January 2009 and available on the www.sciencedirect.com web site were identified and included. The aim was (1) to study levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in human milk in mothers from different geographical areas and assess infant exposure to these contaminants; (2) to study the effect of variables such as the mother's age, number of deliveries, dietary and",
    "Short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in the population exposed to dioxin after the \"Seveso accident\".\tThe early effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) exposure in the population involved in the Seveso, Italy, incident in 1976, have been examined in numerous studies. Chloracne was the only effect linked with sufficient certainty to dioxin exposure. The possible long-term consequences were investigated with mortality and cancer incidence studies. Mortality and morbidity findings during the 20-year period following the accident showed increased risk from lymphoemopoietic neoplasm, digestive system cancer (rectum in males, and biliary tract among females, in particular) and respiratory system cancer (",

OBJECTIVE: We prospectively investigated the relation of plasma cholesterol ester (CE) and phospholipid (PL) fatty acid composition with the incidence of diabetes mellitus.
