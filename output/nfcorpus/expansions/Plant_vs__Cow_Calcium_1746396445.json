    "When comparing plant-based calcium sources with cow-based sources, several factors should be considered. Plant sources of calcium, such as leafy greens, nuts, and seeds, are often high in other nutrients like fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, which can contribute to overall health. In contrast, cow-based sources of calcium like dairy products provide a more concentrated dose of calcium along with protein and other essential nutrients. \n\nHowever, the bioavailability of calcium can vary between plant and cow sources. While the calcium in dairy products is generally well-absorbed by the body, some plant sources contain compounds that can inhibit calcium absorption. To enhance the absorption of plant-based calcium, it is important to consume a variety of calcium-rich plant foods and pair them with sources of vitamin D, which aids in calcium absorption. \n\nUltimately, whether plant or cow-based sources of calcium are better for an individual depends on their dietary preferences, health goals, and overall nutrient intake. A balanced diet that includes a mix of both plant and animal-based calcium sources can help ensure adequate calcium intake to support bone health and overall well-being.",
    "When considering calcium sources, plant-based options and cow-derived sources come to mind. Plant-based calcium sources include leafy greens, almonds, and tofu, while cow-derived calcium typically comes from dairy products like milk and cheese. Each source has its own benefits and considerations. Plant-based calcium is often more easily absorbed by the body due to the presence of other nutrients that aid in absorption. Additionally, plant-based sources are often lower in saturated fats and may be more environmentally friendly. On the other hand, cow-derived calcium is a more concentrated source of the mineral and provides high-quality protein. Ultimately, the choice between plant and cow calcium depends on individual preferences, dietary needs, and ethical considerations."

    "Plant vs. Cow Calcium Calcium loss after menopause increases the risk of osteoporosis in aging women. This study compares calcium absorption from soymilk fortified with a proprietary phosphate of calcium versus absorption from cow's milk. This cross-sectional study showed that, although vegans had lower dietary calcium and protein intakes than omnivores, veganism did not have an adverse effect on bone mineral density and did not alter body composition. Our objective in this study was to determine the effects of a high-protein and high-potential renal acid load (PRAL) diet on calcium absorption and retention and markers of bone metabolism. Associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutritional and biochemical variables were explored. Calcium level predicted hip and spine BMD, and gonadotropin levels were inversely associated with spinal BMD in women.",

    "Calcium absorption in Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women: an acute comparative study of fortified soymilk to cows' milk.\tCalcium loss after menopause increases the risk of osteoporosis in aging women. Soymilk is often consumed to reduce menopausal symptoms, although in its native form, it contains significantly less calcium than cow's milk. Moreover, when calcium is added as a fortificant, it may not be absorbed efficiently. This study compares calcium absorption from soymilk fortified with a proprietary phosphate of calcium versus absorption from cow's milk. Preliminary studies compared methods for labelling the calcium fortificant either before or after its addition to soymilk. It was established that fortificant labelled after it was added to",
    "Intolerance of cow's milk and chronic constipation in children.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of intolerance of cow's milk among children. On the basis of a prior open study, we hypothesized that intolerance of cow's milk can also cause severe perianal lesions with pain on defecation and consequent constipation in young children. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, crossover study comparing cow's milk with soy milk in 65 children (age range, 11 to 72 months) with chronic constipation (defined as having one bowel movement every 3 to 15 days). All had been referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic and had previously been treated with laxatives",
    "Effect of vitamin C supplements on urinary oxalate and pH in calcium stone-forming patients.\tBACKGROUND: The contribution of ascorbate to urinary oxalate is controversial. The present study aimed to determine whether urinary oxalate and pH may be affected by vitamin C supplementation in calcium stone-forming patients. METHODS: Forty-seven adult calcium stone-forming patients received either 1 g (N=23) or 2 g (N=24) of vitamin C supplement for 3 days and 20 healthy subjects received 1 g. A 24-hour urine sample was obtained both before and after vitamin C for calcium, oxalate, magnesium, citrate, sodium, potassium, and creatinine determination. The Tiselius index was",
    "Paleolithic vs. modern diets--selected pathophysiological implications.\tThe nutritional patterns of Paleolithic humans influenced genetic evolution during the time segment within which defining characteristics of contemporary humans were selected. Our genome can have changed little since the beginnings of agriculture, so, genetically, humans remain Stone Agers--adapted for a Paleolithic dietary regimen. Such diets were based chiefly on wild game, fish and uncultivated plant foods. They provided abundant protein; a fat profile much different from that of affluent Western nations; high fibre; carbohydrate from fruits and vegetables (and some honey) but not from cereals, refined sugars and dairy products; high levels of micronutrients and probably of phytochemicals as well.",
    "Veganism, bone mineral density, and body composition: a study in Buddhist nuns.\tSUMMARY: This cross-sectional study showed that, although vegans had lower dietary calcium and protein intakes than omnivores, veganism did not have adverse effect on bone mineral density and did not alter body composition. INTRODUCTION: Whether a lifelong vegetarian diet has any negative effect on bone health is a contentious issue. We undertook this study to examine the association between lifelong vegetarian diet and bone mineral density and body composition in a group of postmenopausal women. METHODS: One hundred and five Mahayana Buddhist nuns and 105 omnivorous women (average age = 62, range = 50-85) were randomly",
    "The impact of dietary protein on calcium absorption and kinetic measures of bone turnover in women.\tAlthough high-protein diets induce hypercalciuria in humans, the source of the additional urinary calcium remains unclear. One hypothesis is that the high endogenous acid load of a high-protein diet is partially buffered by bone, leading to increased skeletal resorption and hypercalciuria. We used dual stable calcium isotopes to quantify the effect of a high-protein diet on calcium kinetics in women. The study consisted of 2 wk of a lead-in, well-balanced diet followed by 10 d of an experimental diet containing either moderate (1.0 g/kg) or high (2.1 g/",
    "Cow's milk allergy is associated with recurrent otitis media during childhood.\tTo determine whether cow's milk allergy (CMA) in infancy is associated with recurrent otitis media (ROM) or other chronic ear infections, we conducted a cohort study by enrolling 56 milk-allergic and 204 control schoolchildren. We also studied the association between ear problems and different atopic manifestations. A higher proportion of children with CMA had had ROM. defined as at least 15 acute otitis media episodes by the age of 10 years (27%, vs 12%, p = 0.009), and had undergone adenoidectomy and or tympanostomy compared with the controls (48%, vs 28%,",

In a randomized crossover design, 16 postmenopausal women consumed 2 diets: 1 with low protein and low PRAL (LPLP; total protein: 61 g/d; PRAL: -48 mEq/d) and 1 with high protein and high PRAL (HPHP; total protein: 118 g/d; PRAL: 33 mEq/d)",
    "Treatment of Hypovitaminosis D in Infants and Toddlers\tContext: Hypovitaminosis D appears to be on the rise in young children, with implications for skeletal and overall health. Objective: The objective of the study was to compare the safety and efficacy of vitamin D2 daily, vitamin D2 weekly, and vitamin D3 daily, combined with supplemental calcium, in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and lowering PTH concentrations. Design: This was a 6-wk randomized controlled trial. Setting: The study was conducted at an urban pediatric clinic in Boston. Subjects: Forty otherwise healthy infants and toddlers with hypovitaminosis D [25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml] participated in the study",
    "Skeletal health in adult patients with classic galactosemia.\tSUMMARY: This study evaluated bone health in adults with galactosemia. Associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutritional and biochemical variables were explored. Calcium level predicted hip and spine BMD, and gonadotropin levels were inversely associated with spinal BMD in women. These results afford insights into management strategies for these patients. INTRODUCTION: Bone loss is a complication of galactosemia. Dietary restriction, primary ovarian insufficiency in women, and disease-related alterations of bone metabolism may contribute. This study examined relationships between clinical factors and BMD in patients with galactosemia. METHODS: This cross-sectional sample included 33 adults (16 women) with"
