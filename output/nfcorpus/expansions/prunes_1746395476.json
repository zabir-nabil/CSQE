    "Report: prunes and liver function: a clinical trial.\tPrunes are used by folks as a remedy of various diseases including hepatitis. A clinical trial was designed to see the effects of prunes (Prunus domestica) on liver function. 166 healthy volunteers were divided into three groups randomly. Either three (about 11.43g) or six (23g approx.) prunes were soaked in a glass of water (250ml) overnight. Each subject from two test groups was asked to drink prune juice & eat whole fruit(single or double dose of prunes) as well, early in the morning, daily for 8 weeks; whereas each subject from control group was given a glass",

    "Randomised clinical trial: dried plums (prunes) vs. psyllium for constipation.\tBACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic constipation remains challenging with 50% of patients dissatisfied with current therapy. There is an unmet need for natural and safe alternatives. Dried plums (prunes) have been used traditionally for constipation but their efficacy is not known. Aim To assess and compare the effects of dried plums and psyllium in patients with chronic constipation. METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in an 8-week, single-blind, randomised cross-over study. Subjects received either dried plums (50 g b.d., fibre=6 gm/day) or psyllium (11 g b.d., fibre=6 gm/",
    "Intakes of Garlic and Dried Fruits Are Associated with Lower Risk of Spontaneous Preterm Delivery\tSeveral studies have found associations between microbial infections during pregnancy and preterm delivery (PTD). We investigated the influence of food with antimicrobial and prebiotic components on the risk of spontaneous PTD. A literature search identified microbes associated with spontaneous PTD. Subsequently, 2 main food types (alliums and dried fruits) were identified to contain antimicrobial components that affect the microbes associated with spontaneous PTD; they also contained dietary fibers recognized as prebiotics. We investigated intake in 18,888 women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa), of whom 950 (5%) underwent spontaneous PTD (<37 gestational",
