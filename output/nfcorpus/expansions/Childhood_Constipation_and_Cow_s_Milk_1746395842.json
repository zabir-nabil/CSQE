    "Childhood constipation is a common issue that parents may face with their young children. One potential factor that has been explored in relation to childhood constipation is the consumption of cow's milk. Cow's milk contains lactose, a type of sugar that some children may have difficulty digesting, leading to potential digestive issues such as constipation. Additionally, some children may also have a sensitivity or intolerance to the protein in cow's milk, which could exacerbate digestive problems.\n\nIf a child is experiencing chronic constipation, it may be beneficial for parents to consider the role of cow's milk in their diet. In some cases, switching to a lactose-free or non-dairy alternative may help alleviate constipation symptoms. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before making any significant changes to a child's diet, as they can provide guidance on appropriate dietary modifications and potential alternatives to cow's milk.\n\nOverall, while cow's milk is a nutritious source of calcium and other essential nutrients for many children, it is important to be mindful of its potential impact on digestive health, especially in cases of childhood constipation. By being aware of the relationship between cow's milk and constipation, parents can make informed decisions about their child's diet to promote better digestive health and overall well-being.",
    "Childhood constipation is a common issue that can be influenced by various factors, including diet. One potential link that has been identified is the consumption of cow's milk. Cow's milk has long been a staple in many children's diets, but studies have shown that it may cause or worsen constipation in some individuals.\n\nThe proteins and fats in cow's milk can be difficult for some children to digest, leading to constipation. Additionally, the lactose in milk can also cause digestive issues in individuals who are lactose intolerant. Switching to a lactose-free or plant-based milk alternative may help alleviate constipation in some cases.\n\nIt is important for parents and caregivers to pay attention to their child's dietary habits and bowel movements to identify any potential triggers for constipation. Consulting with a pediatrician or a registered dietitian can provide guidance on making appropriate dietary changes to help alleviate constipation and promote overall digestive health in children."

    "Cow's-milk-free diet as a therapeutic option in childhood chronic constipation.\tOBJECTIVES: It has been reported that a number of children with constipation respond to a diet free of cow's-milk (CM) proteins, although evidence is lacking to support an immunoglobulin E-mediated mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed an open-label crossover study comparing CM and rice milk in 69 children who fulfilled Rome III criteria for chronic constipation. Clinical, physical, and immunologic parameters of patients who responded (R) and who did not respond (NR) to a CM-free diet were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five of the 69 children (51%",
    "The Role of Cow's Milk Allergy in Pediatric Chronic Constipation: A Randomized Clinical Trial\tObjective Cow's milk allergy has different presentations in children and can cause functional bowel symptoms such as chronic constipation. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of cow's milk allergy as a cause of chronic constipation and effect of cow's milk free diet (CMFD) on its treatment in children. Methods We performed a randomized clinical study comparing CMFD with cow's milk diet (CMD) in two groups each consisting of 70 patients (age range, 1-13 years) with chronic functional constipation (defined as Rome III criteria). All subjects had been referred to",
    "Intolerance of cow's milk and chronic constipation in children.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of intolerance of cow's milk among children. On the basis of a prior open study, we hypothesized that intolerance of cow's milk can also cause severe perianal lesions with pain on defecation and consequent constipation in young children. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, crossover study comparing cow's milk with soy milk in 65 children (age range, 11 to 72 months) with chronic constipation (defined as having one bowel movement every 3 to 15 days). All had been referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic and had previously been treated with laxatives",
    "Cows milk consumption in constipation and anal fissure in infants and young children.\tOBJECTIVE: To examine daily cows milk consumption and duration of breastfeeding in infants and young children with anal fissure and constipation. METHODS: Two groups of 30 consecutive children aged between 4 months and 3 years were evaluated retrospectively. Group I comprised children with chronic constipation and anal fissure in whom surgical causes were excluded, and group II comprised normal children. The daily consumption of cows milk, duration of breastfeeding and other clinical features of the children were investigated RESULTS: The mean daily consumption of cows milk was significantly higher in group I (756 mL, range 200-1500 mL) than group II",
    "Cow's milk protein intolerance and chronic constipation in children.\tCow's milk protein (CMP) allergy was investigated in 25 children (age-range 3 months to 11 years) with chronic constipation. A diagnosis of constipation was made on the basis of a history of painful elimination of hard stools for at least 1 month, whether or not associated with a reduced frequency of stools or soiling. The children were evaluated using clinical parameters and the following laboratory tests: total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE); specific IgE (radioallergosorbent test [RAST]) for whole cow's milk, alpha-lactoalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and a food group; and skin-",
    "Chronic constipation as a symptom of cow milk allergy.\tTwenty-seven consecutive infants (mean age, 20.6 months) with chronic \"idiopathic\" constipation were studied to investigate the possible relation between constipation and cow milk protein allergy (CMPA). The infants were initially observed on an unrestricted diet, and the number of stools per day was recorded. Subsequently the infants were put on a diet free of cow milk protein (CMP) for two periods of 1 month each, separated by two challenges with CMP. During the CMP-free diet, there was a resolution of symptoms in 21 patients; during the two consecutive challenges, constipation reappeared within 48 to 72 hours",
    "Excessive Leucine-mTORC1-Signalling of Cow Milk-Based Infant Formula: The Missing Link to Understand Early Childhood Obesity\tIncreased protein supply by feeding cow-milk-based infant formula in comparison to lower protein content of human milk is a well-recognized major risk factor of childhood obesity. However, there is yet no conclusive biochemical concept explaining the mechanisms of formula-induced childhood obesity. It is the intention of this article to provide the biochemical link between leucine-mediated signalling of mammalian milk proteins and adipogenesis as well as early adipogenic programming. Leucine has been identified as the predominant signal transducer of mammalian milk, which stimulates the nutrient-sensitive kinase mammalian target of",
