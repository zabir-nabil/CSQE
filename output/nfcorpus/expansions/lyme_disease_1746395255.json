    "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected deer ticks. The characteristic early symptom of Lyme disease is a red, expanding rash, known as erythema migrans, that may appear at the site of the tick bite. Other common symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more severe complications affecting the joints, heart, and nervous system.\n\nEarly detection and treatment are important in managing Lyme disease effectively. Antibiotics are typically prescribed to eliminate the bacteria and prevent further complications. Preventive measures, such as wearing long sleeves and pants in wooded areas, using insect repellent, and conducting tick checks after spending time outdoors, can help reduce the risk of contracting Lyme disease. Seeking medical attention promptly if you suspect you have been bitten by a tick or are experiencing symptoms associated with Lyme disease is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment.",
    "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. This disease is commonly transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Symptoms of Lyme disease can vary widely, but often include fever, fatigue, joint pain, and a characteristic \"bull's-eye\" rash. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more serious complications affecting the heart, joints, and nervous system. Early detection and treatment with antibiotics are crucial in managing Lyme disease and preventing long-term health problems. It is important to take precautions when spending time in wooded or grassy areas where ticks are prevalent, such as wearing protective clothing and using insect repellent to reduce the risk of Lyme disease transmission."

    "STARI, or Masters disease: Lone Star tick-vectored Lyme-like illness.\tLyme-like illness (also known as southern tick-associated rash illness [STARI] or Masters disease) is vectored by the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Lyme-like illness lesions, which are similar to the erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease, tend to have lymphocytic dermal infiltrates. With the exception of Borrelia lonestari, the possible causative agent or agents of Lyme-like illness have not been cultured. More research is needed to fully understand this newly recognized zoonosis. Clinicians are encouraged to increase their knowledge and awareness of this Lyme disease mimic.",
    "Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) in the North: STARI following a tick bite in Long Island, New York.\tThe most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease is the characteristic rash, erythema migrans (EM). In the 1980s EM-like eruptions were reported in Missouri and other southeastern states. The EM-like eruptions, which were of unknown etiology, often followed the bite of the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) and the rash is called STARI (southern tick-associated rash illness). Although the Lone Star tick is found in the Lyme disease-endemic areas of New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States,",
    "Forecasting the global burden of Alzheimer's disease.\tBACKGROUND: Our goal was to forecast the global burden of Alzheimer's disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progression. METHODS: A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43% of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing",
    "Mortality in the Baltimore union poultry cohort: non-malignant diseases.\tBACKGROUND: Workers in poultry plants have high exposure to a variety of transmissible agents present in poultry and their products. Subjects in the general population are also exposed. It is not known whether many of these agents cause disease in humans. If they do, we reason this would be readily evident in a highly exposed group such as poultry workers. We report here on mortality from non-malignant diseases in a cohort of poultry workers. METHODS: Mortality was compared with that of the US general population, and with that of a comparison group from the same union. Risk was estimated by standardized mortality",
    "Association of Sleep Duration with Mortality from Cardiovascular Disease and Other Causes for Japanese Men and Women: the JACC Study\tStudy Objectives: To examine sex-specific associations between sleep duration and mortality from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Community-based study. Participants: A total of 98,634 subjects (41,489 men and 57,145 women) aged 40 to 79 years from 1988 to 1990 and were followed until 2003. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: During a median follow-up of 14.3 years, there were 1964 deaths (men and women: 1038 and 926) from stroke, 881 (508 and 373) from coronary heart",
    "Diverticular disease of the colon. The first of the Western diseases shown to be due to a deficiency of dietary fibre.\tDiverticular disease of the colon is a new disease that appeared at the beginning of this century. It is now the commonest disease of the colon in the Western world, being found in 1 in 3 people of over 60 years of age. The pathogenesis of the disease involves excessive segmentation, but this does not explain its aetiology. The historical appearance of the disease on the clinical scene and its geographical distribution suggest that it is due to the removal of fibre from carbohydrates. The author treated 70 patients with symptomatic diverticular disease with a high-fibre",
    "Plant foods and the risk of cerebrovascular diseases: a potential protection of fruit consumption.\tStudies on the association between plant foods and cerebrovascular diseases have given contradictory results suggesting the existence of some effect-modifying factors. The present study determines whether the consumption of plant foods (i.e. fruits and berries, vegetables, and cereals) predicts a decreased cerebrovascular disease incidence in a population with low fruit and vegetable and high wholegrain intake. This cohort study on 3932 men and women was based on data from the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey, conducted in 1968-72. The participants were 40-74 years of age and free of cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Data on the",
    "The Vascular Endothelium and Human Diseases\tAlterations of endothelial cells and the vasculature play a central role in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of the most dreadful of human diseases, as endothelial cells have the key function of participating in the maintenance of patent and functional capillaries. The endothelium is directly involved in peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, insulin resistance, chronic kidney failure, tumor growth, metastasis, venous thrombosis, and severe viral infectious diseases. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium is thus a hallmark of human diseases. In this review the main endothelial abnormalities found in various human diseases such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and viral infections are addressed",
    "Are autoimmune diseases predictable?\tAutoimmune diseases are complex diseases resulting of the interaction between both genetics and environmental factors over time. Different phases in the development of autoimmune diseases are characterized by the detection of serum autoantibodies several months or years before the onset of clinical manifestations and subsequent diagnosis. In addition to serum antibodies, genetic susceptibility factors may predict the future development of the disease. Currently, prediction in type 1 diabetes is the most accurate, with the analysis of genetic susceptibility factors in first-degree relatives of patients and several autoantibody tests. In the future, multiple antibodies test, in combination with the analysis of genetics, epigenetics and immunological anomalies in fine models may allow",
    "Consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish, and nuts and risk of inflammatory disease mortality.\tBACKGROUND: n-3 (omega-3) Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), fish, and nuts can regulate inflammatory processes and responses. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether dietary intakes of PUFAs [n-3, n-6 (omega-6), and \u03b1-linolenic acid], fish, and nuts were associated with 15-y mortality attributed to noncardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases. DESIGN: The analyses involved 2514 participants aged \u226549 y at baseline. Dietary data were collected by using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire, and PUFA, fish, and nut intakes were calculated. Inflammatory disease mortality was confirmed from"
