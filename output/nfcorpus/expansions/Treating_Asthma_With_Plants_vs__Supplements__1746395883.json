    "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. When it comes to treating asthma with plants versus supplements, there are several factors to consider. \n\nPlants have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to alleviate asthma symptoms. Some plants, such as ginger, turmeric, and licorice root, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce airway inflammation and improve breathing. Additionally, certain plants like peppermint and eucalyptus have been known to act as natural bronchodilators, which can help widen the airways and ease breathing difficulties.\n\nOn the other hand, supplements are concentrated forms of specific nutrients or compounds that may help manage asthma symptoms. For example, omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements have anti-inflammatory properties that could potentially reduce airway inflammation in asthma patients. Additionally, vitamin D supplements have been shown to play a role in regulating the immune system and may help prevent asthma exacerbations.\n\nUltimately, the choice between treating asthma with plants or supplements depends on individual preferences, lifestyle factors, and the severity of the condition. Some people may find relief from using plant-based remedies, while others may prefer the convenience and consistency of supplements. It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment regimen to ensure safety and effectiveness.",

    "Randomized placebo-controlled trial of lactobacillus on asthmatic children with allergic rhinitis.\tPrevious studies have suggested that probiotic administration may have therapeutic and/or preventive effects on atopic dermatitis in infants; however, its role in allergic airway diseases remains controversial. To determine whether daily supplementation with specific Lactobacillus gasseri A5 for 8 weeks can improve the clinical symptoms and immunoregulatory changes in school children suffering from asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on school children (age, 6-12 years) with asthma and AR. The eligible study subjects received either L. gasseri A5 (n = 49) or a placebo (n =",
    "Association of dietary soy genistein intake with lung function and asthma control: a post-hoc analysis of patients enrolled in a prospective multicentre clinical trial\tBackground Broad dietary patterns have been linked to asthma but the relative contribution of specific nutrients is unclear. Soy genistein has important anti-inflammatory and other biological effects that might be beneficial in asthma. A positive association was previously reported between soy genistein intake and lung function but not with asthma exacerbations. Aims To conduct a post-hoc analysis of patients with inadequately controlled asthma enrolled in a prospective multicentre clinical trial to replicate this association. Methods A total of 300 study participants were included in the analysis. Dietary soy genistein intake was",
    "A prospective study of diet and adult-onset asthma.\tA role for diet in the pathophysiology of asthma may be mediated by altered immune or antioxidant activity with consequent effects on airway inflammation. We evaluated associations between several dietary factors assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and incidence of asthma over a 10-yr period in 77,866 women 34 to 68 yr of age. Women in the highest quintile of vitamin E intake from diet, but not from supplements, had a risk of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33 to 0.86) compared with women in the lowest quintile. This relationship, however, was attenuated when the contribution from nuts,",
    "Cow's milk allergy is associated with recurrent otitis media during childhood.\tTo determine whether cow's milk allergy (CMA) in infancy is associated with recurrent otitis media (ROM) or other chronic ear infections, we conducted a cohort study by enrolling 56 milk-allergic and 204 control schoolchildren. We also studied the association between ear problems and different atopic manifestations. A higher proportion of children with CMA had had ROM. defined as at least 15 acute otitis media episodes by the age of 10 years (27%, vs 12%, p = 0.009), and had undergone adenoidectomy and or tympanostomy compared with the controls (48%, vs 28%,",
    "Airway and circulating levels of carotenoids in asthma and healthy controls.\tBACKGROUND: Elevated oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defences are increasingly recognised features of asthma. Carotenoids are potent dietary antioxidants that may protect against asthma by reducing oxidative damage. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed firstly, to characterise circulating and airway levels of carotenoids in asthma compared to healthy controls, in relation to dietary intake. Secondly, the study aimed to test whether airway lycopene defences can be improved using oral supplements. METHODS: Induced sputum and peripheral blood samples were collected from subjects with asthma (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 16). Dietary carotenoid intakes were estimated using the 24-hour",
    "Polysaccharides Isolated from A\u00e7a\u00ed Fruit Induce Innate Immune Responses\tThe A\u00e7a\u00ed (Acai) fruit is a popular nutritional supplement that purportedly enhances immune system function. These anecdotal claims are supported by limited studies describing immune responses to the Acai polyphenol fraction. Previously, we characterized \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses to both polyphenol and polysaccharide fractions from several plant-derived nutritional supplements. Similar polyphenol and polysaccharide fractions are found in Acai fruit. Thus, we hypothesized that one or both of these fractions could activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Contrary to previous reports, we did not identify agonist activity in the polyphenol fraction; however, the Acai polysaccharide fraction induced robust \u03b3\u03b4 T cell stimulatory activity in human, mouse",
    "Low vegetable intake is associated with allergic asthma and moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness.\tBACKGROUND: In recent decades, children's diet quality has changed and asthma prevalence has increased, although it remains unclear if these events are associated. OBJECTIVE: To examine children's total and component diet quality and asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a proxy for asthma severity. METHODS: Food frequency questionnaires adapted from the Nurses' Health Study and supplemented with foods whose nutrients which have garnered interest of late in relation to asthma were administered. From these data, diet quality scores (total and component), based on the Youth Healthy Eating Index (YHEI adapted) were",

The aims of this study were to describe any latitudinal variation in the prevalence of childhood allergy in Australia and to evaluate, in parallel, the individual associations between ultraviolet radiation (UVR)- and vitamin D-related measures and hayfever asthma and both conditions. Participants were population-based controls who took part in a multicenter case-control study, aged 18-61",
    "Manipulating antioxidant intake in asthma: a randomized controlled trial.\tBACKGROUND: Antioxidant-rich diets are associated with reduced asthma prevalence in epidemiologic studies. We previously showed that short-term manipulation of antioxidant defenses leads to changes in asthma outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a high-antioxidant diet compared with those of a low-antioxidant diet, with or without lycopene supplementation, in asthma. DESIGN: Asthmatic adults (n = 137) were randomly assigned to a high-antioxidant diet (5 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit daily; n = 46) or a low-antioxidant diet (\u22642 servings of vegetables and 1 serving",
    "Lycopene-rich treatments modify noneosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma: proof of concept.\tAntioxidant-rich diets are associated with reduced asthma prevalence. However, direct evidence that altering intake of antioxidant-rich foods affects asthma is lacking. The objective was to investigate changes in asthma and airway inflammation resulting from a low antioxidant diet and subsequent use of lycopene-rich treatments. Asthmatic adults (n=32) consumed a low antioxidant diet for 10 days, then commenced a randomized, cross-over trial involving 3 x 7 day treatment arms (placebo, tomato extract (45 mg lycopene/day) and tomato juice (45 mg lycopene/day)).
