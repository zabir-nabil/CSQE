    "In the ongoing debate between pharmacists and health food store employees on who provides better advice, it is important to consider the expertise and qualifications of each profession. Pharmacists undergo rigorous educational requirements and training to become licensed healthcare professionals with in-depth knowledge of medications, drug interactions, and proper dosages. They are trained to provide accurate information on prescription medications and help manage complex health conditions. On the other hand, health food store employees may have knowledge of natural remedies, supplements, and wellness products, but their education and training may vary widely. While they can offer guidance on a range of health products, their expertise and ability to provide comprehensive health advice may be limited compared to a pharmacist. Ultimately, when seeking advice on medications and health conditions, consulting a pharmacist would offer more specialized and reliable guidance. However, for general wellness and natural remedies, health food store employees can still provide valuable insights and recommendations. It is important for individuals to consider the context of their health needs and the specific expertise of each professional when seeking advice on health-related matters."

Many patients visit specific complementary practitioners, while others attempt to educate themselves, trusting advice from employees at local health food stores or the Internet.

    "The marketing of dietary supplements in North America: the emperor is (almost) naked.\tBACKGROUND: Many different dietary supplements are being sold in North America. The quality of the evidence supporting their efficacy covers a wide spectrum: Some are based on solid science (such as vitamin D and fish oil), whereas with most supplements there is little or no supporting evidence. Types of supplements commonly sold include exotic fruit juices (such as goji juice) and single herbs or mixture of herbs. Common claims made in support of particular supplements are that they are rich in antioxidants, induce detoxification, stimulate the immune system, and cause weight loss.

    "Tea or coffee? A case study on evidence for dietary advice.\tThe present paper explores the level of evidence required to justify giving dietary advice to the public. There are important practical differences between the development of public health nutrition guidelines and guidelines for clinical practice. While the gold standard for evidence for clinical practice guidelines is a meta-analysis of a number of randomised controlled trials, this is often unrealistic and sometimes unethical for the evaluation of public health nutrition interventions. Hence, epidemiological studies make up the bulk of evidence for nutrition guidelines. Tea and coffee are an interesting case study in relation to this issue. They are two of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide",
    "Comparing indices of diet quality with chronic disease mortality risk in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study:...\tPoor diet quality is thought to be a leading risk factor for years of life lost.

    "Developing actionable dietary guidance messages: dietary fat as a case study.\tAlthough consumers say they are concerned about nutrition and are aware that eating a healthful diet is important for good health, this knowledge does not always translate into healthful diet behaviors or motivate behavior change. In an effort to better understand consumer attitudes about nutrition and to explore alternatives for communicating dietary advice in language that is meaningful and motivates behavior change, the International Food Information Council (IFIC) conducted qualitative research with consumers (using focus groups) and registered dietitians (using telephone interviews) in 1998 and 1999. Results of the research are presented using dietary fat as a case study. Findings from the IFIC",
