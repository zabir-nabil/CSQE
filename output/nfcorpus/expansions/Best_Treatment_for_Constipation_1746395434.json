    "The best treatment for constipation often involves a combination of lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and, if necessary, over-the-counter or prescribed medications. Increasing fiber intake by consuming more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help soften the stool and promote regular bowel movements. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is also important to keep the digestive system running smoothly. Regular physical activity can help stimulate bowel function.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating probiotics into your diet or taking supplements may help in maintaining a healthy balance of gut bacteria and improve digestion. Over-the-counter laxatives can be used for short-term relief, but it is important not to rely on them too frequently as they can lead to dependency. In some cases, prescription medications or procedures such as biofeedback therapy may be necessary for more severe or chronic cases of constipation. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on individual needs and circumstances.",

    "Diverticular disease: eat your fiber!\tIn industrialized nations, diverticular disease affects up to 70% of individuals by 60 years of age, with symptoms that can range from mild gastrointestinal disturbance to incapacitating pain. Diverticular disease appears to be related to increasing affluence and changed diet: Current theory holds that diverticular disease's origin is low-fiber diet. This explains why its incidence is highest and accelerating in the more prosperous countries where intake of fiber has decreased and intake of milled grains and refined sugars has increased over time. Not all patients develop symptoms, but if they do, the most frequent complaints associated with diverticulosis are cramping in the left-lower quadrant, bloating",
    "Prevalence, symptoms and outcome of constipation in infants and toddlers.\tOBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of constipation in children <or=2 years, describe the symptoms of constipation, and review how often specific interventions were effective.

    "A risk-benefit assessment of cisapride in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.\tCisapride is a substituted benzamide compound that stimulates motor activity in all segments of the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing the release of acetylcholine from the enteric nervous system. Cisapride is administered orally in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndromes and chronic constipation. In gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in both adults and children, cisapride provides symptomatic improvement and mucosal healing. Long term treatment with cisapride is effective in the prevention of relapse of oesophagitis. Cisapride improves gastric emptying rates and improves symptoms in patients with gastroparesis of various origins. Unlike domperidone and metoclopramide",

    "Intolerance of cow's milk and chronic constipation in children.\tBACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of intolerance of cow's milk among children. On the basis of a prior open study, we hypothesized that intolerance of cow's milk can also cause severe perianal lesions with pain on defecation and consequent constipation in young children. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, crossover study comparing cow's milk with soy milk in 65 children (age range, 11 to 72 months) with chronic constipation (defined as having one bowel movement every 3 to 15 days).

    "Clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of a diet rich in insoluble fiber on Parkinson disease.\tIn this study, the effects of a diet rich in insoluble fiber (DRIF) on motor disability and the peripheral pharmacokinetics of orally administered L-dopa in Parkinsonian patients with marked constipation are analyzed. We found a useful effect of a DRIF on plasma L-dopa concentration and motor function. The greatest effect on the plasma L-dopa levels was found early (at 30 and 60 min) after oral administration. There was a relationship between the improvement of constipation and the higher bioavailability of L-dopa. DRIF can be a coadjuvant treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease."
