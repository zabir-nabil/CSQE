    "Fruit and nut bars can be a convenient and nutritious snack option, but like any food, they can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess or as part of a diet that exceeds caloric needs. These bars often contain natural sugars from fruits and energy-dense nuts, which can add up in calories quickly. It's important to be mindful of portion sizes and overall calorie intake when including fruit and nut bars in your diet to avoid potential weight gain. Additionally, choosing bars with minimal added sugars and ingredients can help support a balanced and healthy diet. Remember, weight gain is ultimately influenced by overall calorie intake and expenditure, so monitor your consumption of fruit and nut bars as part of a well-rounded eating plan.",
    "Fruit & Nut bars can be a convenient and satisfying snack option, but whether they cause weight gain depends on various factors. These bars can be nutritious, providing a good balance of fiber, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. However, some fruit & nut bars may also contain added sugars, oils, or other high-calorie ingredients that could contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess.\n\nTo avoid weight gain while enjoying fruit & nut bars, it's essential to pay attention to portion sizes, ingredients, and your overall diet. Including them as part of a balanced diet and consuming them in moderation can help prevent any unwanted weight gain.

    "The effect of the addition of daily fruit and nut bars to diet on weight, and cardiac risk profile, in overweight adults.\tBACKGROUND: The frequency of unhealthful snacking has increased dramatically over the last three decades. Fruits and nuts have been shown to have positive health effects. No study has investigated the aggregate effects of various fruits combined with nuts in the form of snack bars on cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this randomised trial was to investigate the effects of a fruit and nut snack bar on anthropomorphic measures, lipid panel and blood pressure in overweight adults. METHODS: Ninety-four overweight adults (body mass index > 25 kg m(-2)) were randomly",
    "A review of the evidence: nuts and body weight.\tThere is currently no single dietary or lifestyle intervention that is effective in long-term weight loss. Traditional weight loss diets tend to be low in total fat and therefore often restrict nut consumption. However, nuts are an important source of many vitamins, minerals, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This paper reviewed all the available evidence from the literature in relation to nut consumption and body weight. The findings show that the role of nut consumption in body weight management is varied. Nuts, when included as part of an energy-controlled diet, were found in some instances to assist with weight loss. However",
    "Prospective study of nut consumption, long-term weight change, and obesity risk in women\tBackground: Data concerning the long-term association between nut consumption and weight change in a free-living population are sparse. Objective: The objective was to determine the relation between nut consumption and long-term weight change. Design: The participants were 51,188 women in the Nurses' Health Study II aged 20\u201345 y, who had no cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. We prospectively evaluated the dietary intake of nuts and subsequent weight changes from 1991 to 1999. Results: Women who reported eating nuts \u22652 times/wk had slightly less mean (\u00b1 SE) weight gain",
    "Health benefits of nut consumption with special reference to body weight control.\tNuts are an integral part of the Mediterranean food patterns, and their incorporation into the regular diets of human beings is believed to provide many health benefits. The recent recognition of nuts as \"heart-healthy\" foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given a major boost to the positive image of nuts. Nut consumption has been associated with several health benefits, such as antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, cardioprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits, among other functional properties. However, although nuts possess these many health benefits, their consumption has been hampered by a lack of adequate information",
    "Nut consumption, weight gain and obesity: Epidemiological evidence.\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Short-term trials support that adding tree nuts or peanuts to usual diets does not induce weight gain. We reviewed the available epidemiological evidence on long-term nut consumption and body weight changes. We also report new results from the SUN (\"Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra\") cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Published epidemiologic studies with \u22651-yr follow-up were located. Two published reports from large cohorts (SUN and Nurses Health Study-2) showed inverse associations between frequency of nut consumption and long-term weight changes. A beneficial effect of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with tree nuts on",
    "Cardiovascular effects of consumption of black versus English walnuts.\tEnglish walnuts have been shown to decrease cardiovascular disease risk; however, black walnuts do not appear to have not been studied for their cardioprotective effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of English versus black walnut consumption on blood lipids, body weight, fatty-acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes, and endothelial function. Consumption of 30 g of English walnuts per day for 30 days, by 36 human participants, improved blood lipids; the effects of black walnuts were dependent on the participant's sex. Addition of either nut to the diet did not result in weight gain.",
    "Nuts and healthy body weight maintenance mechanisms.\tNuts are rich sources of multiple nutrients and phytochemicals associated with health benefits, including reduced cardiovascular disease risk. This has prompted recommendations to increase their consumption. However, they are also high in fat and are energy dense. The associations between these properties, positive energy balance and body weight raise questions about such recommendations. Numerous epidemiological and clinical studies show that nuts are not associated with weight gain. Mechanistic studies indicate this is largely attributable to the high satiety and low metabolizable energy (poor bioaccessibility leading to inefficient energy absorption) properties of nuts. Compensatory dietary responses account for 55-75% of the energy provided by nuts.",
    "Whole grain intake in relation to body weight: from epidemiological evidence to clinical trials.\tThis viewpoint aims to 1) review the available scientific literature on the relationship between whole grain consumption and body weight regulation; 2) evaluate the potential mechanisms whereby whole grain intake may help reduce overweight and 3) try to understand why epidemiological studies and clinical trials provide diverging results on this topic. All the prospective epidemiological studies demonstrate that a higher intake of whole grains is associated with lower BMI and body weight gain. However, these results do not clarify whether whole grain consumption is simply a marker of a healthier lifestyle or a factor favoring \"per se\" lower body weight. Habitual",
    "Effects of pistachios on body weight in Chinese subjects with metabolic syndrome\tBackground Studies have shown that pistachios can improve blood lipid profiles in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia which could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there is also a widely perceived view that eating nuts can lead to body weight gain due to their high fat content. Purpose To investigate the impact of different dosages of pistachios on body weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose and insulin in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Methods Ninety subjects with metabolic syndrome (consistent with 2005 International Diabetes Federation metabolic syndrome standard without diabetes) were enrolled in three endocrinology outpatient clinics in Beijing. All subjects received dietary counseling according",
    "The role of exercise in the treatment of obesity.\tThe United States is in the midst of a significant public health problem that relates to obesity and inactivity. This epidemic has far-ranging consequences for our workforce and our children and shows no signs of slowing in the near future. Significant research has been performed on the effects of exercise for the reduction of body weight; results of most studies indicate that exercise alone has a small effect on body-weight reduction independent of caloric restriction. However, when combined with dietary restriction, exercise has a synergistic effect and enhances weight loss beyond the effect of diet alone. In addition, exercise has been shown to have significant"
