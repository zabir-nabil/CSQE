    "Overdosing on greens, specifically consuming an excessive amount of leafy green vegetables, can lead to potential health risks despite the generally positive reputation of these foods. While leafy greens are nutrient-dense and offer a variety of vitamins and minerals, overconsumption can cause certain side effects. Consuming large quantities of greens can lead to an overload of certain nutrients such as calcium, oxalates, and vitamin K, which may have negative impacts on health. Some individuals may experience digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea if they consume an excessive amount of leafy greens. Additionally, certain leafy greens contain compounds that can interfere with thyroid function if consumed in very large quantities. Therefore, it is important to consume leafy greens in moderation and vary your diet to ensure a well-rounded intake of nutrients without risking potential health complications associated with overdosing on greens.",

    "Severe metabolic alkalosis due to baking soda ingestion: case reports of two patients with unsuspected antacid overdose.\tOral ingestion of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) has been used for decades as a home remedy for acid indigestion. Excessive bicarbonate ingestion places patients at risk for a variety of metabolic derangements including metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and even hypoxia. The clinical presentation is highly variable but can include seizures, dysrhythmias, and cardiopulmonary arrest. We present two cases of severe metabolic alkalosis in patients with unsuspected antacid overdose. The presentation and pathophysiology of antacid-related metabolic alkalosis is reviewed.",
    "Safety of sildenafil citrate: review of 67 double-blind placebo-controlled trials and the postmarketing safety database\tAim: To review special safety topics associated with sildenafil and to document the tolerability of 50- and 100-mg doses, overall and by age, in men with erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods: Data were collated from 67 double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) trials (> 14,000 men) conducted by the manufacturer and from the manufacturer\u2019s postmarketing safety database (39,277 patients). The DBPC data were stratified by dose, starting dose and age (\u2265 65 and \u2265 75 years). Special safety topics included cardiovascular risk, priapism, non",
    "Too much of too little: xylitol, an unusual trigger of a chronic metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis.\tHomeopathic globules are frequently used in children as a first-line treatment. Most of these globules are coated with sugar substitutes like xylitol; these substitutes are known for their laxative effect. Our patient shows that consumption of globules coated with xylitol does not have only laxative effects. It may cause indeed considerable weight loss and life-threatening enteral bicarbonate loss by diarrhea when overdosed in an infant.",
    "Atrial fibrillation associated with chocolate intake abuse and chronic salbutamol inhalation abuse.\tThe use of substances as the substrate for atrial fibrillation is not frequently recognized. Chocolate is derived from the roasted seeds of the plant theobroma cacao and its components are the methylxanthine alkaloids theobromine and caffeine. Caffeine is a methylxanthine whose primary biological effect is the competitive antagonism of the adenosine receptor. Normal consumption of caffeine was not associated with risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Sympathomimetic effects, due to circulating catecholamines cause the cardiac manifestations of caffeine overdose toxicity, produce tachyarrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.The commonly used doses of inhaled or nebulized salbutamol induced no",
    "Steam cooking significantly improves in vitro bile acid binding of collard greens, kale, mustard greens, broccoli, green bell pepper, and cabbage.\tBile acid binding capacity has been related to the cholesterol-lowering potential of foods and food fractions. Lowered recirculation of bile acids results in utilization of cholesterol to synthesize bile acid and reduced fat absorption. Secondary bile acids have been associated with increased risk of cancer. Bile acid binding potential has been related to lowering the risk of heart disease and that of cancer. Previously, we have reported bile acid binding by several uncooked vegetables. However, most vegetables are consumed after cooking. How cooking would influence in vitro bile acid binding",
    "A case of fatal caffeine poisoning.\tCaffeine is a natural alkaloid methylxanthine that is found in various plants such as coffee or tea. Symptoms of a severe overdose may present with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, ventricular arrhythmias, hypertension followed by hypotension, respiratory failure, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, ventricular fibrillation and finally circulatory collapse. A 21-year-old woman called for the ambulance herself soon after the ingestion of about 10,000 mg of caffeine. At the arrival of the ambulance, the patient went into cardiac arrest almost immediately. After a total resuscitation period of 34 min including seven counter-shocks and 2 mg epinephrine, the patient was stable enough to be transferred to the hospital",
    "Green and black tea in relation to gynecologic cancers\tScope Observational studies have evaluated the relationship between green tea intake and cancers of the ovary and endometrium, but we are not aware of the published studies on green tea intake and risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva. Methods and results A critical review of the published literature on tea intake and risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers was conducted. In meta-analyses, we report inverse associations for green tea intake and risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80), and for green tea and risk",
    "Adverse effects of concentrated green tea extracts.\tA myriad of health claims are being made in favor of the consumption of green tea. However, mostly due to the easy availability and greater than ever popularity of highly concentrated green tea extracts, sometimes combined with an attitude of more-is-better, certain health risks of green tea consumption have begun to emerge. Among such risks are the possibility of liver damage, the potential to interact with prescription drugs to alter their therapeutic efficacy, and the chance to cause harm when combined with other highly popular herbal remedies. This review will summarize documented examples of adverse effects of green tea in humans, and will discuss risks of",
    "The Association between Concentrations of Green Tea and Blood Glucose Levels\tOur objective was to examine whether habitual green tea consumption is associated with blood glucose levels and other biomarkers of glucose metabolism. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 35 male volunteers, 23\u201363 years old and residing in Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan. Biochemical data were measured and we conducted a questionnaire survey on health, lifestyle, and nutrition, as well as frequency of consumption and concentrations (1%, 2%, and 3%) of green tea. Men who consumed a 3% concentration of green tea showed lower mean values of fasting blood glucose and fructosamine than those who consumed a 1% concentration.",
    "Green tea: nature's defense against malignancies.\tThe current practice of introducing phytochemicals to support the immune system or fight against diseases is based on centuries old traditions. Nutritional support is a recent advancement in the domain of diet-based therapies; green tea and its constituents are one of the important components of these strategies to prevent and cure various malignancies. The anti-carcinogenic and anti-mutagenic activities of green tea were highlighted some years ago suggesting that it could reduce the prevalence of cancer and even provide protection. The pharmacological actions of green tea are mainly attributed to polyphenols that includes epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin. Green"
