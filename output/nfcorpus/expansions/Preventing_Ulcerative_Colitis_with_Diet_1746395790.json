    "Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can greatly impact an individual's quality of life. While there is no definitive cure for this condition, research suggests that dietary choices may play a role in preventing or managing symptoms of ulcerative colitis.\n\nOne key dietary factor to consider is fiber intake. High-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help promote a healthy gut environment and regulate bowel movements. Additionally, consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts may have anti-inflammatory properties that could benefit individuals with ulcerative colitis.\n\nCertain foods may trigger symptoms and exacerbate inflammation in people with ulcerative colitis. It is important to identify and avoid potential trigger foods such as dairy products, spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Keeping a food diary can help individuals track their dietary intake and identify any patterns or triggers that may worsen their symptoms.\n\nWorking with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian can help individuals develop a personalized nutrition plan that supports their overall health and helps manage ulcerative colitis symptoms. By making informed dietary choices and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, individuals may have a better chance of preventing flare-ups and improving their overall well-being when living with ulcerative colitis.",

    "Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.\tBACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated",
    "Bowel obsession syndrome in a patient with ulcerative colitis.\tGastroenterologists are often faced with the diagnostic problem of differentiating acute symptoms of ulcerative colitis from functional intestinal disorders. Bowel obsession syndrome (BOS) is an OCD-like, functional syndrome characterized by fear of fecal incontinence and compulsive behaviors of evacuation-checking. Only sparse case studies on treatment of BOS with antidepressants have been published. This is the first study on successful psychotherapy of a male patient with ulcerative colitis overlapping functional bowel symptoms and marked symptoms of BOS. Clinical recognition of BOS may help clinicians in differential diagnosis, prevent unnecessary investigations, and give patients the most appropriate treatment.",

The aim in this trial was to assess the efficacy of curcumin as maintenance therapy in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with quiescent UC were recruited for this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of curcumin in the prevention of relapse. Forty-five patients received curcumin, 1g after breakfast and 1g after the evening meal, plus sulfasalazine (SZ)",
    "Curcumin, an active component of turmeric in the prevention and treatment of ulcerative colitis: preclinical and clinical observations.\tInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprising of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is a major ailment affecting the small and large bowel. In clinics, IBD is treated using 5-amninosalicylates, antibiotics, the steroids and immunomodulators. Unfortunately, the long term usages of these agents are associated with undue side effects and compromise the therapeutic advantage. Accordingly, there is a need for novel agents that are effective, acceptable and non toxic to humans. Preclinical studies in experimental animals have shown that curcumin, an active principle of the Indian",
    "An association between dietary arachidonic acid, measured in adipose tissue, and ulcerative colitis.\tBACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary arachidonic acid, an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-6 PUFA), might be involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether high levels of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue samples (which reflects dietary intake) are associated with UC. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from 57,053 men and women in the EPIC-Denmark Prospective Cohort Study from 1993 to 1997. Adipose tissue biopsy samples were collected from gluteal regions at the beginning of the study, the cohort was monitored over subsequent years, and participants who",
    "Influence of dietary factors on the clinical course of ulcerative colitis: a prospective cohort study\tBackground and aims: The causes of relapses of ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. Dietary factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aim of this study was to determine which dietary factors are associated with an increased risk of relapse of UC. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed with UC patients in remission, recruited from two district general hospitals, who were followed for one year to determine the effect of habitual diet on relapse. Relapse was defined using a validated disease activity index. Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorised into tertiles.",
    "Immune potentiation of ultrafine dietary particles in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\tVarious specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters",
    "Antagonistic effects of sulfide and butyrate on proliferation of colonic mucosa: a potential role for these agents in the pathogenesis of ulcerativ...\tIt has been shown that feces of patients with ulcerative colitis uniformly contain sulfate reducing bacteria. Sulfide produced by these bacteria interferes with butyrate-dependent energy metabolism of cultured colonocytes and may be involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Mucosal biopsies from the sigmoid rectum of 10 patients (no caner, polyps, inflammatory bowel disease) were incubated with either NaCl, sodium hydrogen sulfide (1 mmol/L), a combination of both sodium hydrogen sulfide and butyrate (10 mmol/L), or butyrate. Mucosal proliferation was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine",

However, few prospective studies have examined associations between long-term intake of dietary fiber and risk of incident CD or UC. Methods We collected and analyzed data from 170,776 women, followed over 26 y, who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, followed for 3,317,425 person-y.
