    "Caloric restriction is a dietary regimen that involves consuming fewer calories than usual, with the goal of improving health and possibly increasing longevity. Studies have shown that reducing calorie intake can lead to various health benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, and protection against age-related diseases. By limiting calorie intake, the body may be able to activate certain genes and cellular processes that promote longevity and overall well-being. However, it is important to note that caloric restriction should be done carefully and under the supervision of a healthcare provider to ensure that essential nutrients are still being consumed. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, including implementing caloric restriction.",
    "Caloric restriction is a dietary practice that involves reducing the number of calories consumed while still maintaining necessary nutrients for optimal health. This practice has been studied for its potential health benefits, including increased lifespan, improved metabolic health, and potential protection against age-related diseases. By consuming fewer calories than the body needs to maintain its weight, caloric restriction is believed to activate certain cellular pathways that promote longevity and overall well-being. It is important to remember that caloric restriction should be practiced in a balanced and safe manner, as extreme restriction can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health issues. As always, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or nutritionist before making significant changes to your diet."

    "Caloric restriction and incidence of breast cancer.\tCONTEXT: Restricting caloric intake is one of the most effective ways to extend lifespan and to reduce spontaneous tumor occurrence in experimental animals, but whether similar associations hold in humans has not been appropriately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether caloric restriction in early life reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study using data from the Swedish Inpatient Registry, the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Swedish Death Registry, and the Swedish Fertility Registry. Participants were 7303 Swedish women hospitalized for anorexia nervosa prior to age 40 years between 1965 and 1998. Women were excluded (n = 31) if they",

The low caloric intake, long life expectancy, and the high prevalence of centenarians in Okinawa have been used as an argument to support the CR hypothesis in humans. However, no long-term, epidemiologic analysis has been conducted on traditional dietary patterns, energy balance, and potential CR phenotypes for the specific cohort of Okinawans who are purported",
    "From the Cover: Caloric restriction improves memory in elderly humans\tAnimal studies suggest that diets low in calories and rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) are beneficial for cognitive function in age. Here, we tested in a prospective interventional design whether the same effects can be induced in humans. Fifty healthy, normal- to overweight elderly subjects (29 females, mean age 60.5 years, mean body mass index 28 kg/m2) were stratified into 3 groups: (i) caloric restriction (30% reduction), (ii) relative increased intake of UFAs (20% increase, unchanged total fat), and (iii) control. Before and after 3 months",
    "Caloric restriction in humans: potential pitfalls and health concerns.\tTo date, the only intervention that has consistently been shown to slow the rate of aging, and to increase mean and maximum lifespan in short-lived species, is life-long calorie restriction. It is yet unclear whether long-term calorie restriction in longer lived species (i.e. primates and humans) will have a similar effect. In humans, several studies investigating short-term calorie restriction or \"weight loss\" programs suggest beneficial outcomes on parameters of cardiovascular disease. Studies on long-term calorie restriction are performed on a self-selected group of human subjects and show similar effects. However, few",
    "Effects of grapefruit, grapefruit juice and water preloads on energy balance, weight loss, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk in free-living obese adults\tBackground Reducing dietary energy density has proven to be an effective strategy to reduce energy intakes and promote weight control. This effect appears most robust when a low energy dense preload is consumed before meals. Yet, much discussion continues regarding the optimal form of a preload. The purpose of the present study was to compare effects of a solid (grapefruit), liquid (grapefruit juice) and water preload consumed prior to breakfast, lunch and dinner in the context of caloric restriction. Methods Eighty-five obese adults (BMI 30",
    "The low-methionine content of vegan diets may make methionine restriction feasible as a life extension strategy.\tRecent studies confirm that dietary methionine restriction increases both mean and maximal lifespan in rats and mice, achieving \"aging retardant\" effects very similar to those of caloric restriction, including a suppression of mitochondrial superoxide generation. Although voluntary caloric restriction is never likely to gain much popularity as a pro-longevity strategy for humans, it may be more feasible to achieve moderate methionine restriction, in light of the fact that vegan diets tend to be relatively low in this amino acid. Plant proteins - especially those derived from legumes or nuts - tend to be lower in methionine than animal",
    "Insights into the beneficial effect of caloric/ dietary restriction for a healthy and prolonged life\tOver the last several years, new evidence has kept pouring in about the remarkable effect of caloric restriction (CR) on the conspicuous bedfellows- aging and cancer. Through the use of various animal models, it is now well established that by reducing calorie intake one can not only increase life span but, also, lower the risk of various age related diseases such as cancer. Cancer cells are believed to be more dependent on glycolysis for their energy requirements than normal cells and, therefore, can be easily targeted by alteration in the energy-metabolic pathways, a hallmark of CR. Apart from",
    "Comparative and meta-analytic insights into life extension via dietary restriction.\tDietary restriction (DR) extends the lifespan of a wide range of species, although the universality of this effect has never been quantitatively examined. Here, we report the first comprehensive comparative meta-analysis of DR across studies and species. Overall, DR significantly increased lifespan, but this effect is modulated by several factors. In general, DR has less effect in extending lifespan in males and also in non-model organisms. Surprisingly, the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension via DR than the degree of caloric restriction. Furthermore, we show that reduction in both age-dependent",
    "Macronutrient balance and lifespan\tDietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition is widely regarded to be a universal mechanism for prolonging lifespan. It is generally believed that the benefits of DR arise from eating fewer calories (termed caloric restriction, CR). Here we argue that, rather than calories, the key determinant of the relationship between diet and longevity is the balance of protein to non-protein energy ingested. This ratio affects not only lifespan, but also total energy intake, metabolism, immunity and the likelihood of developing obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Among various possible mechanisms linking macronutrient balance to lifespan, the nexus between the TOR and AMPK signaling pathways is emerging as a central",
    "The effects of high fructose syrup.\tHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become an increasingly common food ingredient in the last 40 years. However, there is concern that HFCS consumption increases the risk for obesity and other adverse health outcomes compared to other caloric sweeteners. The most commonly used types of HFCS (HFCS-42 and HFCS-55) are similar in composition to sucrose (table sugar), consisting of roughly equal amounts of fructose and glucose. The primary difference is that these monosaccharides exist free in solution in HFCS, but in disaccharide form in sucrose. The disaccharide sucrose is easily cleaved in the small intestine, so free fructose and glucose are absorbed from both sucrose and"
