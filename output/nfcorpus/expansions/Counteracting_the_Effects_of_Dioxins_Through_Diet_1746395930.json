    "Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that can accumulate in the food chain, posing serious health risks to humans. However, there are ways to counteract the effects of dioxins through a healthy diet. One important strategy is to consume a variety of nutritious foods, particularly fruits and vegetables that are rich in antioxidants. These antioxidants can help neutralize the harmful effects of dioxins by reducing oxidative stress in the body. Additionally, choosing organic and locally sourced foods can minimize dioxin exposure, as these products are less likely to contain high levels of these pollutants. Furthermore, incorporating foods high in fiber, such as whole grains and legumes, can help promote detoxification processes in the body, aiding in the elimination of dioxins. By being mindful of our dietary choices and opting for a balanced and wholesome diet, we can help protect our health and mitigate the impacts of dioxin exposure.",
    "Counteracting the effects of dioxins through diet can be a crucial step in minimizing their harmful impacts on the body. Dioxins are highly toxic environmental pollutants that can accumulate in the body over time, leading to various health issues. However, by adopting a diet rich in antioxidants, fiber, and nutrients, individuals can help counteract the effects of dioxins. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and nuts are known to have detoxifying properties that can help eliminate toxins from the body, including dioxins. Additionally, consuming foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish or flaxseeds, can also aid in reducing inflammation and supporting overall immune function, which may help mitigate the negative impacts of dioxins. By prioritizing a balanced and nutritious diet, individuals can support their bodies in combating the harmful effects of dioxins and promoting overall health and well-being."

    "Counteracting the Effects of Dioxins Through Diet, Dioxins invade the body mainly through the diet, and produce toxicity through the transformation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). An inhibitor of the transformation should therefore protect against the toxicity and ideally be part of the diet. We examined flavonoids ubiquitously expressed in plant foods as one of the best candidates, and found that the subclasses flavones and flavonols suppressed antagonistically the transformation of AhR induced by 1 nM of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Reducing dietary exposure to dioxins among the most vulnerable segments of the population (i.e., pregnant women, infants, and young girls) is an effective strategy for reducing body burdens in future generations. Exposure to dioxins through foods can be minimized by selecting lower-fat versions of meats, poultry, and dairy products. Li et al. (2011) now show that specific dietary compounds present in cruciferous vegetables act through the AhR to promote intestinal immune function, revealing AhR as a critical link between diet and immunity. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons including dioxins and non-halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ligands of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and stimulate its transformation. Exposure to these environmental contaminants occurs mainly through diet. This review introduces recent articles that have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms by which food factors regulate the AhR transformation and downstream drug-metabolizing enzymes.",

    "Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from the maternal diet may be associated with immunosuppressive effects that persist int...\tWe investigated whether prenatal exposure from the maternal diet to the toxicants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins is associated with the development of immune-related diseases in childhood. Children participating in BraMat, a sub-cohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), were followed in the three first years of life using annual questionnaires (0-3years; n=162, 2-3years; n=180), and blood parameters were examined at three years of age (n=114). The maternal intake of the toxicants was calculated using a validated food frequency",
    "Simulated impact of a fish based shift in the population n--3 fatty acids intake on exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds.\tDue to the favourable health effects of LC n-3 PUFAs, marine products have been recognised as a food group of special importance in the human diet. However, seafood is susceptible to contamination by lipophilic organic pollutants. The objective of this study was to evaluate intake levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs, by a probabilistic Monte Carlo procedure, in relation to the recommendation on LC n-3 PUFAs given by Belgian Federal Health Council. Regarding the recommendation, two scenarios were developed differing in LC n-3 PUFAs intake: a 0.3 E% and a",
    "The many faces of methylmercury poisoning.\tMethylmercury (MM) is a very potent neurotoxic agent. Its role in polluting the environment is well documented. A vast amount of study over the past several decades has finally provided insight into many aspects of its effect. Exposure to MM may be through ingestion of poisoned fish or inadvertent misuse of grain treated with the poison as a fungicide. Major epidemics have occurred in Japan (Fetal Minamata disease), Iraq, Pakistan, Guatemala, and Ghana. Sporadic incidences have occurred in the United States and Canada. There is no effective antidote to counteract the effect of MM on the central nervous system, although the information documented should provide",
    "Fresh aromatic herbs containing methylchavicol did not exhibit the pro-oxidative effects of pure methylchavicol on a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2.\tMethylchavicol (CH(3)-CV), an important aromatic constituent of different plants like tarragon and basils, has been shown to be carcinogenic by a mechanism yet unclear, although it has been reported that carcinogenicity of CH(3)-CV in rodent might be linked to its metabolic conversion into a genotoxic electrophilic metabolite generated through a two steps bioactivation pathway catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes and sulfotransferases. The induction of carcinogenesis by certain agents has been associated with the generation of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to determine whether pure methylchavicol applied on a human hepatoma cell",
