    "Medical ethics refers to the moral principles that guide the practice of medicine and healthcare. It involves making decisions that are informed by values such as honesty, respect for patients' autonomy, beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice. In the field of medicine, ethical dilemmas can arise when there are conflicting interests or values, such as balancing the autonomy of a patient with the responsibility of a healthcare provider to provide the best possible care. Medical professionals are expected to adhere to ethical standards and codes of conduct in order to ensure the well-being and safety of their patients. By upholding ethical principles, healthcare providers can maintain trust, integrity, and professionalism in their practice.",
    "Medical ethics is a branch of ethics that deals with moral principles and values in the practice of medicine. It involves considering issues such as patient autonomy, confidentiality, informed consent, end-of-life care, and the duty of healthcare professionals to provide the best possible care to their patients. In essence, medical ethics guides healthcare providers in making decisions that are morally sound and respectful of the dignity and rights of patients. By adhering to ethical standards, healthcare professionals can ensure that they prioritize the well-being and interests of their patients above all else, ultimately upholding the trust and integrity of the medical profession."

    "medical ethics, Is it ever right to prescribe placebos to patients in clinical practice? The potential problem with placebos is that they may involve deception, and an ethical tension arises over the patient's autonomy and the physician's requirement to be open and honest. I argue for the inseparability of questions of social history and social theory from any normative assessment of medical practices. The focus of the discussion is the legitimacy of the social authority exercised by physicians and traditional approaches to defending or critiquing such authority. Although placebos can be shown to be always safe, often effective, and sometimes necessary, doctors are now effectively prohibited from using them in clinical practice. I argue that the deceptive administration of placebos is not subject to the same moral objections that face other forms of deception in clinical practice. The use of placebos is central to medicine but even more pivotal to psychosocial therapies. Our study aims to review attitudes and beliefs concerning placebos outside of clinical research. To describe the attitudes and behaviors regarding placebo treatments among US internists and rheumatologists. The survey measured physicians' self-reported behaviors, attitudes, ethical judgments, and communication about the use of placebo treatments. Sixty-five percent of Danish clinicians reported using placebo interventions at least once, and 48% reported using them more than ten times in the last year. The most important reason for the use of placebo interventions was to avoid potential harm to patients.",
    "medical ethics, The potential problem with placebos is that they may involve deception: indeed, if this is the case, an ethical tension arises over the patient's autonomy and the physician's requirement to be open and honest, and the notion that medical care should be the primary concern. I argue that the deceptive administration of placebos is not subject to the same moral objections that face other forms of deception in clinical practice and medical research. While different professionals often confound the meanings of placebo effects with placebo responses, physicians continue to prescribe placebos as part of clinical practice.

    "Deception as treatment: the case of depression.\tIs it ever right to prescribe placebos to patients in clinical practice? The General Medical Council is ambivalent about the issue; the American Medical Association asserts that placebos can be administered only if the patient is (somehow) 'informed'. The potential problem with placebos is that they may involve deception: indeed, if this is the case, an ethical tension arises over the patient's autonomy and the physician's requirement to be open and honest, and the notion that medical care should be the primary concern. This paper examines the case of depression as an entry point for understanding the complexities of the prescription of placebos.",
    "Medical practice and social authority.\tQuestions of medical ethics are often treated as especially difficult casuistical problems or as difficult cases illustrative of paradoxes or advantages in global moral theories. I argue here, in opposition to such approaches, for the inseparability of questions of social history and social theory from any normative assessment of medical practices. The focus of the discussion is the question of the legitimacy of the social authority exercised by physicians, and the insufficiency of traditional defences of such authority in liberal societies (voluntarist, informed consent approaches), as well as traditional attacks on such strategies (ideology critique). Seeing such authority as institution bound and role based, it is argued,",
    "US medical researchers, the Nuremberg Doctors Trial, and the Nuremberg Code. A review of findings of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Expe...\tThe Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE), established to review allegations of abuses of human subjects in federally sponsored radiation research, was charged with identifying appropriate standards to evaluate the ethics of cold war radiation experiments. One central question for ACHRE was to determine what role, if any, the Nuremberg Code played in the norms and practices of US medical researchers. Based on the evidence from ACHRE's Ethics Oral History Project and extensive archival research, we conclude that the Code, at the time it was promulgated, had",
    "A duty to deceive: placebos in clinical practice.\tAmong medical researchers and clinicians the dominant view is that it is unethical to deceive patients by prescribing a placebo. This opinion is formalized in a recent policy issued by the American Medical Association (AMA [Chicago, IL]). Although placebos can be shown to be always safe, often effective, and sometimes necessary, doctors are now effectively prohibited from using them in clinical practice. I argue that the deceptive administration of placebos is not subject to the same moral objections that face other forms of deception in clinical practice and medical research. Although deception is normally objectionable on the grounds that it limits autonomy and breaches trust",
    "Placebos in clinical practice: comparing attitudes, beliefs, and patterns of use between academic psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrists.\tControversial and ethically tenuous, the use of placebos is central to medicine but even more pivotal to psychosocial therapies. Scholars, researchers, and practitioners largely disagree about the conceptualization of placebos. While different professionals often confound the meanings of placebo effects with placebo responses, physicians continue to prescribe placebos as part of clinical practice. Our study aims to review attitudes and beliefs concerning placebos outside of clinical research. Herein we compare patterns of placebo use reported by academic psychiatrists with those reported by physicians from different specialties across Canadian medical schools. Using a web-based tool, we",
    "A survey of placebo use in a general hospital.\tTwo hundred thirty registered nurses and seventy physicians participated in a retrospective study scrutinizing placebo effects, prescribing patterns, and staff attitudes in a university-based general hospital setting. Despite copious experimental literature devoted to placebo effects over the past thirty years, the medical and surgical use of placebos seems to disregard experimental data. Although 80% of the staff had used placebos in the hospital, their knowledge of placebo effects was in many respects deficient. Within the hospital, 89% of placebo use was directed toward the amelioration of \"pain\"; the authors believe that emphasis should be placed on the education of staff to perceive",
    "The use of placebo interventions in medical practice--a national questionnaire survey of Danish clinicians.\tThe authors sent a questionnaire to 772 randomly selected Danish clinicians and asked them about their use of placebo interventions. Sixty-five percent responded. Among the general practitioners, 86% (95% confidence interval 81-91) reported to have used placebo interventions at least once, and 48% (41-55) to have used placebo interventions more than ten times, within the last year. Hospital-based doctors and private specialists reported to have used placebo interventions less frequently (p < .001). The most important reason for the use of placebo interventions was to avoid",

    "Property rights and genetic engineering: developing nations at risk.\tEighty percent of (commercial) genetically engineered seeds (GES) are designed only to resist herbicides. Letting farmers use more chemicals, they cut labor costs. But developing nations say GES cause food shortages, unemployment, resistant weeds, and extinction of native cultivars when \"volunteers\" drift nearby. While GES patents are reasonable, this paper argues many patent policies are not. The paper surveys GE technology, outlines John Locke's classic account of property rights, and argues that current patent policies must be revised to take account of Lockean ethical constraints. After answering a key objection, it provides concrete suggestions for implementing",
    "A framework for identification of infections that contribute to human obesity.\tWHO has declared obesity to be a global epidemic. Obesity management strategies mainly target behavioural components of the disorder, but are only marginally effective. A comprehensive understanding of the causative factors of obesity might provide more effective management approaches. Several microbes are causatively and correlatively linked with obesity in animals and human beings. If infections contribute to human obesity, then entirely different prevention and treatment strategies and public health policies could be needed to address this subtype of the disorder. Ethical reasons preclude experimental infection of human beings with candidate microbes to unequivocally determine their contribution to obesity. As an alternative, the available information about the"
