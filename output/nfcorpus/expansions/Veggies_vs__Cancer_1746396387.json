    "Eating a diet rich in vegetables has been shown to have a positive impact on reducing the risk of cancer. Vegetables are packed with essential nutrients, antioxidants, and fiber that support a healthy immune system and help the body fight off cancer cells. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts contain compounds that have been linked to lower rates of certain cancers. Additionally, vegetables such as carrots, spinach, and bell peppers provide a variety of vitamins and minerals that promote overall health and well-being. By incorporating a variety of colorful vegetables into your daily meals, you can take proactive steps towards reducing your risk of cancer and supporting your body's natural defenses.",
    "Research has shown that incorporating a variety of vegetables into your diet can potentially help in reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. Vegetables are rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support a healthy immune system and help combat oxidative stress in the body. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, kale, and cauliflower contain compounds that have been linked to reducing the growth of cancer cells. Other vegetables like tomatoes, carrots, and spinach are high in carotenoids and other phytochemicals that also possess cancer-fighting properties. By regularly consuming a diverse array of vegetables, you can strengthen your body's defense against cancer and promote overall well-being. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dietary recommendations related to cancer prevention."

    "Prognostic and therapeutic implications of mTORC1 and Rictor expression in human breast cancer.\tThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in the regulation of cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation. It forms two multi-protein complexes known as complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2). Raptor and Rictor are the core proteins for mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. This study examines the relationship between mTORC1, Rictor and Raptor mRNA expression and human breast cancer. Furthermore, the correlation between mTORC1 and hTERT was investigated. Breast cancer tissues (n=150) and normal tissues (n=31) were analysed using reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. Transcript levels were correlated with clinicopathological",
