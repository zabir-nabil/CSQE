    "Assessing the level of chemical contamination in our environment and within ourselves is a complex and ongoing endeavor. From industrial pollutants to pesticides in agriculture, our exposure to potentially harmful chemicals is widespread. Researchers and environmental agencies continuously monitor levels of contaminants in air, water, soil, and even in our food and consumer products. Additionally, biomonitoring studies analyze levels of chemicals in human tissues and fluids to provide insight into our internal exposure. While the extent of chemical contamination varies regionally and depends on factors such as lifestyle choices and occupation, it is evident that we are not free from exposure to these substances. By understanding the sources of contamination, implementing stricter regulations, and making informed choices about the products we use, we can work towards reducing our chemical burden and safeguarding our health and the environment.",
    "Assessing the level of chemical contamination in our daily lives is a complex and multi-faceted issue. From the products we use to the food we consume, exposure to chemicals is a widespread concern. Common chemicals like pesticides, heavy metals, and additives can accumulate in our bodies over time, potentially leading to health risks. Furthermore, environmental pollution from industrial activities contributes to the presence of harmful substances in our air, water, and soil. Regular monitoring, regulation, and public awareness are crucial in addressing and reducing chemical contamination to safeguard our health and the environment."

    "How Chemically Contaminated Are We? The objective of this article is to extend our previous studies of persistent organic pollutant (POP) contamination of U.S. food by measuring perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in composite food samples. The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of different food types to phthalate exposure. Therefore a united approach comprising consistent standards, sound science and robust controls is required to ensure consumers' health and to maintain consumers' confidence and satisfaction. There is now compelling evidence that developmental exposure to chemicals from our environment contributes to disease later in life.",

    "Perfluorinated Compounds, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and Organochlorine Pesticide Contamination in Composite Food Samples from Dallas, Texas, USA\tObjectives The objective of this article is to extend our previous studies of persistent organic pollutant (POP) contamination of U.S. food by measuring perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in composite food samples. This study is part of a larger study reported in two articles, the other of which reports levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane brominated flame retardants in these composite foods [Schecter et al. 2010. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclodecane (HBCD) in composite U.S. food samples, Environ Health Perspect 118:357\u2013362].",
    "Dietary Intake Is Associated with Phthalate Body Burden in a Nationally Representative Sample\tBackground Phthalates are compounds that are used in a wide range of consumer products. However, the contribution of dietary intake to phthalate exposure has not been well defined. Objective The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of different food types to phthalate exposure. Phthalates are chemicals of concern because of the high levels measured in people and the environment, as well as the demonstrated toxicity in animal studies and limited epidemiological studies. Previous research, although limited, has suggested that phthalates contaminate food in various countries. Methods We conducted an exploratory analysis of data collected as part of the 2003\u20132004 National Health and",
    "Persistence of human norovirus in reconstituted pesticides--pesticide application as a possible source of viruses in fresh produce chains.\tThe consumption of fresh produce is frequently associated with outbreaks of human norovirus (hNoV) disease. To prevent the contamination of fresh produce with hNoV, knowledge of the possible introduction sources of the viruses, such as water, is needed to be able to implement appropriate and efficient preventive measures. Contaminated water used to reconstitute pesticides could be a relevant source of infectious hNoV, determined by the initial level of virus contamination and the persistence of these viruses in reconstituted pesticides. We studied the persistence of hNoV GI.4, hNoV GII.4 and murine norovirus (MNV-1), the",
    "Estimating changes in public health following implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point in the United States broiler slaughter i...\tA common approach to reducing microbial contamination has been the implementation of a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) program to prevent or reduce contamination during production. One example is the Pathogen Reduction HACCP program implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). This program consisted of a staged implementation between 1996 and 2000 to reduce microbial contamination on meat and poultry products. Of the commodities regulated by FSIS, one of the largest observed reductions was for Salmonella contamination on broiler chicken carcasses. Nevertheless, how this reduction might",
    "Influence of a five-day vegetarian diet on urinary levels of antibiotics and phthalate metabolites: a pilot study with \"Temple Stay\" participants.\tDiet is purported to be means of exposure to many environmental contaminants. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of dietary change on the levels of exposure to several environmental chemicals - in particular, antibiotics and phthalates. For this purpose, we examined the extent to which short-term changes in diet influenced the inadvertent exposure levels to these chemicals in an adult population. We recruited participants (n=25) of a five-day 'Temple Stay' program in Korea and collected urine samples before and after the program.",
    "Marine Food Pollutants as a Risk Factor for Hypoinsulinemia and Type 2 Diabetes\tBackground Some persistent environmental chemicals are suspected of causing an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a disease particularly common after age 70. This concern was examined in a cross-sectional study of elderly subjects in a population with elevated contaminant exposures from seafood species high in the food chain. Methods Clinical examinations of 713 Faroese residents aged 70-74 years (64% of eligible population) included fasting plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Lifetime exposure to persistent environmental chemicals from pilot whale and other traditional food was estimated from a dietary questionnaire and by analysis of blood samples for polychlorinated",
    "Thirdhand cigarette smoke in an experimental chamber: evidence of surface deposition of nicotine, nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons...\tBACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence shows that secondhand cigarette smoke undergoes numerous chemical changes after it is released into the air: it can adsorb to indoor surfaces, desorb back into the air and undergo chemical changes as it ages. OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of aging on the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nicotine and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cigarette smoke. METHODS: We generated sidestream and mainstream cigarette smoke with a smoking machine, diluted it with conditioned filtered air, and passed it through a 6 m(3) flow reactor with air",
    "Cancer and non-cancer health effects from food contaminant exposures for children and adults in California: a risk assessment\tBackground In the absence of current cumulative dietary exposure assessments, this analysis was conducted to estimate exposure to multiple dietary contaminants for children, who are more vulnerable to toxic exposure than adults. Methods We estimated exposure to multiple food contaminants based on dietary data from preschool-age children (2\u20134 years, n=207), school-age children (5\u20137 years, n=157), parents of young children (n=446), and older adults (n=149). We compared exposure estimates for eleven toxic compounds (acrylamide, arsenic, lead, mercury, chlorpyrifos, permethrin,",
    "Chemical safety of meat and meat products.\tSince the Second World War the consumer behaviour in developed countries changed drastically. Primarily there existed the demand for sufficient food after a period of starvation, afterwards the desire for higher quality was arising, whereas today most people ask for safe and healthy food with high quality. Therefore a united approach comprising consistent standards, sound science and robust controls is required to ensure consumers' health and to maintain consumers' confidence and satisfaction. Chemical analysis along the whole food chain downstream (tracking) from primary production to the consumer and upstream (tracing) from the consumer to primary production is an important prerequisite to ensure food safety and quality.",
    "Environmental toxicants and the developing immune system: a missing link in the global battle against infectious disease?\tThere is now compelling evidence that developmental exposure to chemicals from our environment contributes to disease later in life, with animal models supporting this concept in reproductive, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast, data regarding how developmental exposures impact the susceptibility of the immune system to functional alterations later in life are surprisingly scant. Given that the immune system forms an integrated network that detects and destroys invading pathogens and cancer cells, it provides the body\u2019s first line of defense. Thus, the consequences of early-life exposures that reduce immune function are profound. This review summarizes"
