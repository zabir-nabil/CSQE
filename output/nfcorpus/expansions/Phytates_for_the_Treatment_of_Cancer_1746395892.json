    "Phytates, compounds found in plant-based foods such as whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, have been the subject of research interest for their potential role in cancer treatment. Studies suggest that phytates may exhibit anti-cancer properties by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, inducing apoptosis (cell death), and reducing the spread of tumors. Additionally, phytates have shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy drugs while reducing their side effects. Although more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which phytates may exert their anti-cancer effects and to determine optimal dosages, these findings suggest that incorporating phytate-rich foods into a balanced diet may hold potential benefits for cancer treatment and prevention.",
    "Recent research has shown promising results regarding the potential use of phytates in the treatment of cancer. Phytates, naturally occurring compounds found in plant-based foods such as grains, seeds, and legumes, have been found to possess anti-cancer properties.

Additionally, phytates have been shown to inhibit certain enzymes and signaling pathways that are involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival.\n\nWhile more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of phytates in cancer treatment, the current evidence is promising. Incorporating phytate-rich foods into a balanced diet may offer a natural and potentially effective way to complement existing cancer treatments.

    "Phytates for the Treatment of Cancer, Protective effect of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (phytate) on bone mass loss in postmenopausal women. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the relationship between urinary concentrations of InsP6, bone mass loss, and risk fracture in postmenopausal women. A total of 157 postmenopausal women were included in the study: 70 had low (\u22640.76 \u03bcM), 42 intermediate (0.76-1.42 \u03bcM), and 45 high (\u22651.42 \u03bcM) urinary phytate concentrations.

    "Phytate levels and bone parameters: a retrospective pilot clinical trial.\tThis study evaluated the relationship between phytate urinary levels and bone characteristics in a large population of postmenopausal women. The study population consisted of 180 postmenopausal women who participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study. A urine sample was collected from each subject to determine phytate levels and the volunteers were divided into two groups according to phytate urinary concentration (i.e., low and high levels). Bone mineral density was determined in the lumbar spine and femoral neck of groups with low and high phytate urinary levels. Urinary levels of phytate were linked to dietary phytate consumption. Hence, bone mineral density values were significantly higher in",
    "The role of phytic acid in legumes: antinutrient or beneficial function?\tThis review describes the present state of knowledge about phytic acid (phytate), which is often present in legume seeds. The antinutritional effects of phytic acid primarily relate to the strong chelating associated with its six reactive phosphate groups. Its ability to complex with proteins and particularly with minerals has been a subject of investigation from chemical and nutritional viewpoints. The hydrolysis of phytate into inositol and phosphates or phosphoric acid occurs as a result of phytase or nonenzymatic cleavage. Enzymes capable of hydrolysing phytates are widely distributed in micro-organisms, plants and animals. Phytases act in a stepwise manner to catalyse the hydrolysis of",
    "Phytate in foods and significance for humans: food sources, intake, processing, bioavailability, protective role and analysis.\tThe article gives an overview of phytic acid in food and of its significance for human nutrition. It summarises phytate sources in foods and discusses problems of phytic acid/phytate contents of food tables. Data on phytic acid intake are evaluated and daily phytic acid intake depending on food habits is assessed. Degradation of phytate during gastro-intestinal passage is summarised, the mechanism of phytate interacting with minerals and trace elements in the gastro-intestinal chyme described and the pathway of inositol phosphate hydrolysis in the gut presented. The present knowledge of phytate absorption is summarised and",
    "Phytate (myo-inositol hexaphosphate) and risk factors for osteoporosis.\tSeveral risk factors seem to play a role in the development of osteoporosis. Phytate is a naturally occurring compound that is ingested in significant amounts by those with diets rich in whole grains. The aim of this study was to evaluate phytate consumption as a risk factor in osteoporosis. In a first group of 1,473 volunteer subjects, bone mineral density was determined by means of dual radiological absorptiometry in the calcaneus. In a second group of 433 subjects (used for validation of results obtained for the first group), bone mineral density was determined in the lumbar column and the neck of the femur. Subjects were",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 157 postmenopausal women were included in the study: 70 had low (\u22640.76 \u03bcM), 42 intermediate (0.76-1.42 \u03bcM) and 45 high (\u22651.42 \u03bcM) urinary phytate concentrations. Densitometry values for neck were measured at enrollment and after 12 months (lumbar spine and femoral neck), and 10-year risk fracture was calculated using the tool FRAX(\u00ae). RESULTS:",
    "Ascorbic acid prevents the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of polyphenols and phytates on nonheme-iron absorption.\tThe effects of maize-bran phytate and of a polyphenol (tannic acid) on iron absorption from a white-bread meal were tested in 199 subjects. The phytate content was varied by adding different concentrations of phytate-free and ordinary maize bran. Iron absorption decreased progressively when maize bran containing increasing amounts of phytate phosphorous (phytate P) (from 10 to 58 mg) was given. The inhibitory effect was overcome by 30 mg ascorbic acid. The inhibitory effects of tannic acid (from 12 to 55 mg) were also dose dependent. Studies suggested that greater",
    "Effect of phytic acid on the absorption, distribution, and endogenous excretion of zinc in rats.\tZinc metabolism in male rats was studied by combining nutritional balance methods with an analysis of 65Zn kinetics. The rats, two groups of 84 each, were fed zinc-adequate diets (33 ppm Zn) with either 0 (basal) or 2% phytic acid added as sodium phytate. A fourth-order exponential function described the time-course of 65Zn in plasma, and compartmental models were developed accordingly. Plasma zinc exchanged more rapidly with zinc in liver and kidneys than it did with zinc in testes, skeletal muscle, or bone. Total body zinc content (2.6",
    "Dietary suppression of colonic cancer. Fiber or phytate?\tThe incidence of colonic cancer differs widely between various human populations. It has been suggested that dietary fiber content is of utmost importance and is inversely related to the occurrence of colonic cancer. However, high-fiber diets are not always correlated with low frequency of colonic cancer, suggesting the involvement of additional dietary constituents. Inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid) is an abundant plant seed component present in many, but not all, fiber-rich diets. The authors have found that phytic acid is a potent inhibitor of iron-mediated generation of the hazardous oxidant, hydroxyl radical. Herein, the authors propose that inhibition of",
    "Effects of meals and meal times on uptake of lead from the gastrointestinal tract in humans.\tTwenty three adults ingested 203Pb as lead acetate on the 12th hour of a 19 h fast. Retention measured 7 days later in a whole-body counter was 61% and whole-body turnover rates suggested that initial uptake had been considerably greater. Balanced meals eaten with 203Pb reduced lead uptake to 4% and the influence of the food lasted for up to 3 h. The effects of phytate, ethylene-diaminetetra acetate (EDTA), caffeine, alcohol, glucose, a liquid meal and a light snack were tested separately with intermediate results. The effect of a meal was probably",
    "Neuroprotective effect of the natural iron chelator, phytic acid in a cell culture model of Parkinson's disease.\tDisrupted iron metabolism and excess iron accumulation has been reported in the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Because excessive iron can induce oxidative stress subsequently causing degradation of nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD, we determined the protective effect of a naturally occurring iron chelator, phytic acid (IP6), on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced cell death in immortalized rat mesencephalic/dopaminergic cells. Cell death was induced with MPP(+) in normal and iron-excess conditions and cytotoxicity was measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) and trypan blue staining."
