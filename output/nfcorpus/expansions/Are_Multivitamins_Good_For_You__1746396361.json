    "Multivitamins can be beneficial for certain individuals, particularly those who have nutrient deficiencies or dietary restrictions. For individuals who struggle to meet their daily recommended intake of essential vitamins and minerals through food alone, multivitamins can serve as a convenient supplement to help bridge nutritional gaps. However, it is important to note that multivitamins are not a substitute for a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Furthermore, excessive intake of certain vitamins and minerals through supplementation can have adverse effects on health. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian before incorporating multivitamins into your daily routine to ensure they are appropriate and necessary for your individual health needs.",
    "Multivitamins can be a beneficial supplement for individuals who struggle to meet their daily nutrient requirements through diet alone. They can help fill any nutritional gaps and provide essential vitamins and minerals that may be lacking in one's diet. However, it is important to note that multivitamins should not replace a healthy and balanced diet. It is always best to obtain nutrients from whole foods whenever possible. Additionally, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to ensure that it is appropriate for your specific health needs and goals. Ultimately, while multivitamins can be a helpful tool in promoting overall health and well-being, they should be used in conjunction with a nutritious diet and lifestyle."

    "Viscous versus nonviscous soluble fiber supplements: mechanisms and evidence for fiber-specific health benefits.\tPURPOSE: This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. DATA SOURCES: Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. CONCLUSIONS: While it is generally known that \"fiber is good for you,\" it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Many of the health benefits of fiber can be directly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers when hydrated (i.e.",

    "Multivitamin-multimineral supplementation and mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\tBACKGROUND: Multivitamins are the most commonly used supplement in the developed world. Recent epidemiologic findings suggest that multivitamin use increases the risk of mortality. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether multivitamin-multimineral treatment, used for primary or secondary prevention, increases the risk of mortality in independently living adults. DESIGN: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Multiple electronic databases were systematically searched from March to October 2012. Randomized controlled primary or secondary prevention trials were considered for inclusion. Eligible trials investigated daily multivitamin-multimineral supplementation for \u22651 y.
