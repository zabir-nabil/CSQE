    "When faced with the age-old dilemma of whether to snack or not, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and individual needs. Snacking can provide a quick energy boost, curb hunger between meals, and offer a moment of enjoyment during a busy day. However, excessive snacking can also contribute to unwanted weight gain and disrupt healthy eating patterns. It's important to listen to your body's hunger cues and make mindful choices when deciding whether to snack. Choosing nutrient-dense snacks like fruits, nuts, or yogurt can help satisfy cravings while supporting overall health. On the other hand, if you find yourself snacking out of boredom or stress, it may be beneficial to explore alternative ways to cope with emotions and engage in self-care activities that don't involve food. Ultimately, the decision to snack or not should be guided by balance, moderation, and awareness of one's own body and habits.",

    "Glucose and insulin responses to manufactured and whole-food snacks.\tTo determine whether realistic snacks containing added sugar evoke excessive insulin responses, 10 healthy subjects consumed four different snack meals, similar in fat and total energy content. Two snacks were based on sugary, manufactured products (chocolate-coated candy bar; cola drink with crisps) and two on whole foods (raisins and peanuts; bananas and peanuts). After the processed-food snacks, plasma-glucose levels tended to rise higher and to fall lower than after the whole-food snacks. The area under the plasma insulin curve was 70% greater after the manufactured snacks than after the raisin-peanut snack",
    "An after-school snack of raisins lowers cumulative food intake in young children.\tSnacks are an important part of children's dietary intake, but the role of dried fruit on energy intake in children is unknown. Therefore, the effect of ad libitum consumption of an after-school snack of raisins, grapes, potato chips, and chocolate chip cookies on appetite and energy intake in twenty-six 8- to 11-y-old normal-weight (15th to 85th percentile) children was examined. On 4 separate weekdays, 1 wk apart, children (11 M, 15 F) were given a standardized breakfast, morning snack (apple), and a standardized",
    "Raisins compared with other snack effects on glycemia and blood pressure: a randomized, controlled trial.\tOBJECTIVE: To compare effects of raisin snacks with conventional snacks on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial compared 3-times-a-day consumption of raisins with intake of processed snacks on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors. Men and women were randomized to snacks (n = 15) or raisins (n = 31). Outcome measures were performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose levels were not significantly affected by intake of raisins or snacks. Mean subject post",

Children randomly received 1 of 4 ad libitum (Experiment 1: 13 boys, 13 girls) or fixed-calorie (150 kcal; Experiment 2: 13 boys, 13 girls) treatments, followed by an ad libitum pizza meal 30 min later. Appetite was measured throughout the study, and FI was measured",
    "Satiereal, a Crocus sativus L extract, reduces snacking and increases satiety in a randomized placebo-controlled study of mildly overweight, health...\tSnacking is an uncontrolled eating behavior, predisposing weight gain and obesity. It primarily affects the female population and is frequently associated with stress. We hypothesized that oral supplementation with Satiereal (Inoreal Ltd, Plerin, France), a novel extract of saffron stigma, may reduce snacking and enhance satiety through its suggested mood-improving effect, and thus contribute to weight loss. Healthy, mildly overweight women (N = 60) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that evaluated the efficacy of Satiereal supplementation on",
    "The effect of the addition of daily fruit and nut bars to diet on weight, and cardiac risk profile, in overweight adults.\tBACKGROUND: The frequency of unhealthful snacking has increased dramatically over the last three decades. Fruits and nuts have been shown to have positive health effects. No study has investigated the aggregate effects of various fruits combined with nuts in the form of snack bars on cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this randomised trial was to investigate the effects of a fruit and nut snack bar on anthropomorphic measures, lipid panel and blood pressure in overweight adults. METHODS: Ninety-four overweight adults (body mass index > 25 kg m(-2)) were randomly",

Forty-five healthy, normal-weight subjects participated in this randomised within-subject crossover study. Statistical analysis of",
    "The color red reduces snack food and soft drink intake.\tBased on evidence that the color red elicits avoidance motivation across contexts (Mehta & Zhu, 2009), two studies investigated the effect of the color red on snack food and soft drink consumption. In line with our hypothesis, participants drank less from a red labeled cup than from a blue labeled cup (Study 1), and ate less snack food from a red plate than from a blue or white plate (Study 2). The results suggest that red functions as a subtle stop signal that works outside of focused awareness and thereby reduces incidental food and drink intake. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Serving styles of raw snack vegetables. What do children want?\tThe primary aim of this study was to investigate how serving styles of snack vegetables appeal to children, focusing on size and shape. A secondary aim was to investigate children's willingness to participate in fruit and vegetable subscription services at school, and how these could be designed. One hundred and thirty eight children aged 9-12 years indicated their liking for a snack meal comprising a combination of carrots, cucumber, and red pepper. The meal was presented in eight different serving styles: two sizes; small and ordinary, and four shapes; whole/chunk, slices, sticks, and figures (stars",
    "Dietary predictors of 5-year changes in waist circumference.\tBACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between macronutrient intake and the development of abdominal obesity, which carries an increased health risk, have not shown a consistent pattern, possibly due to mixed effects of other aspects of the food intake. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between intake from 21 food and beverage groups and the subsequent 5-year difference in waist circumference. METHODS: The study population consisted of 22,570 women and 20,126 men, aged 50 to 64 years at baseline, with complete data on baseline and follow-up waist circumference, baseline diet (192 items food frequency questionnaire), body mass index"
