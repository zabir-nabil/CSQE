    "Energy drinks are beverages that typically contain high levels of caffeine, along with other ingredients like sugar, vitamins, and herbs. These drinks are marketed as products that can provide a quick energy boost and enhance focus and alertness. While they can be effective in temporarily increasing energy levels, consuming too many energy drinks or relying on them regularly can have negative consequences. Excessive consumption of energy drinks can lead to health issues such as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, insomnia, and even more serious conditions like heart problems and increased anxiety. It is important to be mindful of the amount of energy drinks consumed and to consider healthier alternatives for sustained energy, such as getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced diet.",

These beverages are marketed as providing a quick energy boost, often through high doses of caffeine and other stimulants. While some people find energy drinks helpful for staying alert and awake, there are concerns about their potential negative effects on health.\n\nMany energy drinks contain high amounts of caffeine, which can lead to jitteriness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. In excessive amounts, caffeine can also cause serious side effects such as heart palpitations and even caffeine overdose. Additionally, the high sugar content in some energy drinks can contribute to weight gain and dental problems.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of how much and how often energy drinks are consumed. Moderation is key to avoiding potential health risks associated with these beverages.

    "energy drinks Detrimental effects of energy drink consumption on platelet and endothelial function. We tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial function. Platelet function was assessed before and after the consumption of a sugar-free energy drink. The erosive potential of the tested agents was quantified as the changes in surface hardness of enamel specimens within the first 2 hours. We selected sixty agents: soft drinks, an energy drink, sports drinks, alcoholic drinks, juice, fruit, mineral water, yogurt, tea, coffee, salad dressing, and medications. The health concerns that have been raised about the amounts of sugar in the current diet, primarily as beverages, are the subject of this review. Soft drinks and fruit drinks account for just under 50% of added sugars intake."

    "Detrimental effects of energy drink consumption on platelet and endothelial function.\tBACKGROUND: Energy drink consumption has been anecdotally linked with sudden cardiac death and, more recently, myocardial infarction. As myocardial infarction is strongly associated with both platelet and endothelial dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial function. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers (34 male, aged 22+/-2 years) participated in the study. Platelet aggregation and endothelial function were tested before, and 1 hour after, the consumption of 250 mL (1 can) of a sugar-free energy drink. Platelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphate-induced (1 micromol/L) optical aggregometry in",
    "Dietary sugars intake and cardiovascular health: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\tHigh intakes of dietary sugars in the setting of a worldwide pandemic of obesity and cardiovascular disease have heightened concerns about the adverse effects of excessive consumption of sugars. In 2001 to 2004, the usual intake of added sugars for Americans was 22.2 teaspoons per day (355 calories per day). Between 1970 and 2005, average annual availability of sugars/added sugars increased by 19%, which added 76 calories to Americans' average daily energy intake. Soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugars in Americans' diets. Excessive consumption of sugars has been",
    "Analysis of the erosive effect of different dietary substances and medications.\tExcessive consumption of acidic drinks and foods contributes to tooth erosion. The aims of the present in vitro study were twofold: (1) to assess the erosive potential of different dietary substances and medications; (2) to determine the chemical properties with an impact on the erosive potential. We selected sixty agents: soft drinks, an energy drink, sports drinks, alcoholic drinks, juice, fruit, mineral water, yogurt, tea, coffee, salad dressing and medications. The erosive potential of the tested agents was quantified as the changes in surface hardness (\u0394SH) of enamel specimens within the first 2",
    "Energy and Fructose From Beverages Sweetened With Sugar or High-Fructose Corn Syrup Pose a Health Risk for Some People\tSugar intake in the United States has increased by >40 fold since the American Revolution. The health concerns that have been raised about the amounts of sugar that are in the current diet, primarily as beverages, are the subject of this review. Just less than 50% of the added sugars (sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) are found in soft drinks and fruit drinks. The intake of soft drinks has increased 5-fold between 1950 and 2000. Most meta-analyses have shown that the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,",
    "Diet supplementation with donkey milk upregulates liver mitochondrial uncoupling, reduces energy efficiency and improves antioxidant and antiinflam...\tDietary PUFA, mainly those of the n-3 family, are known to play essential roles in the maintenance of energy balance and in the reduction of body fat deposition through the upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling that is the main source of reactive oxygen species. We hypothesized that rat supplementation with raw donkey's milk (DM), characterized by low-fat content and higher n3:n6 ratio, may affect energy balance, lipid metabolism, and prooxidant status as compared to animals treated with cow's milk. In the present study, the effects of drinking raw DM (for 4",
    "Glucose and insulin responses to manufactured and whole-food snacks.\tTo determine whether realistic snacks containing added sugar evoke excessive insulin responses, 10 healthy subjects consumed four different snack meals, similar in fat and total energy content. Two snacks were based on sugary, manufactured products (chocolate-coated candy bar; cola drink with crisps) and two on whole foods (raisins and peanuts; bananas and peanuts). After the processed-food snacks, plasma-glucose levels tended to rise higher and to fall lower than after the whole-food snacks. The area under the plasma insulin curve was 70% greater after the manufactured snacks than after the raisin-peanut snack",
    "Arsenic, Organic Foods, and Brown Rice Syrup\tBackground: Rice can be a major source of inorganic arsenic (Asi) for many sub-populations. Rice products are also used as ingredients in prepared foods, some of which may not be obviously rice based. Organic brown rice syrup (OBRS) is used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. We hypothesized that OBRS introduces As into these products. Objective: We determined the concentration and speciation of As in commercially available brown rice syrups and in products containing OBRS, including toddler formula, cereal/energy bars, and high-energy foods used by endurance athletes.",
    "Yerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) consumption is associated with higher bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.\tYerba Mate (Ilex paraguariensis) tea consumption is higher in Argentina and other South American countries than those of coffee or tea (Camellia sinensis). The effects of Yerba Mate on bone health have not previously been explored. From a program for osteoporosis prevention and treatment, postmenopausal women who drank at least 1 L of Yerba Mate tea daily during 4 or more years (n=146) were identified, and matched by age and time since menopause with an equal number of women who did not drink Yerba Mate tea. Their bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-",
    "Orange juice or fructose intake does not induce oxidative and inflammatory response.\tOBJECTIVE: We have previously shown that 300 kcal from glucose intake induces a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding in the circulating mononuclear cells in healthy normal subjects. We hypothesized that the intake of 300 calories as orange juice or fructose, the other major carbohydrate in orange juice, would induce a significantly smaller response than that of glucose. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four groups (eight subjects each) of normal-weight subjects were given a 300-cal drink of glucose (75 g), fructose (75 g)",
    "Why the Bush administration and the global sugar industry are determined to demolish the 2004 WHO global strategy on diet, physical activity and he...\tOBJECTIVE: To indicate why the world's most powerful nation state and one powerful sector of the food and drink production and manufacturing industry are determined to demolish the 2004 WHO (World Health Organization) global strategy on diet, physical activity and health, and to disassociate it from the 2003 WHO/FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) expert report on diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases, which with its background papers is the immediate scientific basis for the strategy. To encourage representatives of nation states at the 2004 WHO World"
