    "Galactosemia is a genetic disorder that affects how the body processes galactose, a sugar found in many foods. People with galactosemia are unable to properly break down galactose, leading to a buildup of this sugar in the body. This can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, kidney problems, and cognitive impairments if not managed properly. Treatment typically involves following a strict diet that eliminates foods containing galactose, such as dairy products. It is important for individuals with galactosemia to work closely with healthcare providers to monitor their condition and ensure they are receiving the necessary nutrients while avoiding galactose-containing foods. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing galactosemia and reducing the risk of complications.",
    "Galactosemia is a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to efficiently process galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Individuals with galactosemia lack the enzyme needed to break down galactose, leading to its accumulation in the body. This can result in various health problems, including liver damage, cataracts, and developmental delays if left untreated. Managing galactosemia typically involves adhering to a strict diet that eliminates galactose-containing foods. Early diagnosis and lifelong dietary management are crucial for individuals with galactosemia to minimize the risk of complications and lead a healthy life."

    "Skeletal health in adult patients with classic galactosemia.\tSUMMARY: This study evaluated bone health in adults with galactosemia. Associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and nutritional and biochemical variables were explored. Calcium level predicted hip and spine BMD, and gonadotropin levels were inversely associated with spinal BMD in women. These results afford insights into management strategies for these patients. INTRODUCTION: Bone loss is a complication of galactosemia. Dietary restriction, primary ovarian insufficiency in women, and disease-related alterations of bone metabolism may contribute. This study examined relationships between clinical factors and BMD in patients with galactosemia. METHODS: This cross-sectional sample included 33 adults (16 women) with"
