    "Dietary scoring is a method used to evaluate and quantify the nutritional quality of an individual's diet. It involves assigning various points or scores to different foods or dietary patterns based on their nutritional content. These scores are then used to assess how well a person's diet aligns with recommended guidelines or healthy eating patterns.\n\nDietary scoring systems can vary in complexity and may focus on different aspects of nutrition, such as overall diet quality, specific nutrients, or adherence to a particular diet pattern like the Mediterranean diet or DASH diet. By using these scoring systems, researchers and healthcare professionals can gain valuable insights into an individual's dietary habits and make recommendations for improving their overall health and well-being.\n\nIn a nutshell, dietary scoring provides a structured way to evaluate the nutritional quality of a person's diet and can be a useful tool in promoting healthy eating habits and preventing nutrition-related diseases.",
    "Dietary scoring is a method used to evaluate the quality of an individual's diet based on specific criteria such as nutrient intake, food variety, and adherence to dietary guidelines. By assigning scores to different aspects of a person's diet, dietary scoring systems can provide valuable insights into overall dietary patterns and identify areas for improvement. These scores can help individuals and healthcare professionals assess the nutritional adequacy of diets, track changes over time, and make informed decisions about dietary choices. By focusing on key components of a healthy diet, dietary scoring can be a useful tool in promoting better nutrition and overall well-being."

    "Principal component analysis of dietary and lifestyle patterns in relation to risk of subtypes of esophageal and gastric cancer\tPurpose To perform pattern analyses of dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to risk of esophageal and gastric cancers. Methods We evaluated risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and other gastric cancers (OGA) using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Connecticut, New Jersey, and western Washington state. Dietary/lifestyle patterns were created using principal component analysis (PCA). Impact of the resultant scores on cancer risk was estimated through logistic regression. Results PCA identified",
    "Changes in nutrient intake and dietary quality among participants with type 2 diabetes following a low-fat vegan diet or a conventional diabetes di...\tBACKGROUND: Although vegan diets improve diabetes management, little is known about the nutrient profiles or diet quality of individuals with type 2 diabetes who adopt a vegan diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess the changes in nutrient intake and dietary quality among participants following a low-fat vegan diet or the 2003 American Diabetes Association dietary recommendations. DESIGN: A 22-week randomized, controlled clinical trial examining changes in nutrient intake and diet quality. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Participants with type 2 diabetes (n=99) in a free-living setting.

    "Protein dietary reference intakes may be inadequate for vegetarians if low amounts of animal protein are consumed.\tOBJECTIVE: The health benefits of vegetarian diets are well-recognized; however, long-term adherence to these diets may be associated with nutrient inadequacies, particularly vitamins B12 and D, calcium, iron, zinc, and protein. The dietary reference intakes (DRIs) expert panels recommended adjustments to the iron, zinc, and calcium DRIs for vegetarians to account for decreased bioavailability, but no adjustments were considered necessary for the protein DRI under the assumption that vegetarians consume about 50% of protein from animal (dairy/egg) sources. This study examined dietary protein sources in",

    "Higher Diet Quality Is Associated with Decreased Risk of All-Cause, Cardiovascular Disease, and Cancer Mortality among Older Adults\tIncreased attention in dietary research and guidance has been focused on dietary patterns, rather than on single nutrients or food groups, because dietary components are consumed in combination and correlated with one another. However, the collective body of research on the topic has been hampered by the lack of consistency in methods used. We examined the relationships between 4 indices\u2014the Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (HEI-2010), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index\u20132010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)\u2014and all-cause, cardiovascular disease",
    "Dietary and clastogenic factors in children who immigrated to Israel from regions contaminated by the Chernobyl accident.\tThe authors evaluated the possible association between dietary history and plasma clastogenic factors in children who immigrated to Israel between 1989 and 1993 from regions contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. The authors compared questionnaire data about demographic variables, dietary histories before and after immigration occurred, and health status with clastogenic factor scores for 162 immigrants. Logistic regression analysis revealed a negative association between clastogenic factor scores and frequency of consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit among children < or = 7 yr of age during the postimmigration period. Intake of eggs and fish by boys who were < or = 7 yr of age",
    "The association between dietary patterns and mental health in early adolescence.\tOBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between dietary patterns and mental health in early adolescence. METHOD: The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study is a prospective study of 2900 pregnancies recruited from 1989-1992. At 14 years of age (2003-2006; n=1324), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess behaviour (characterising mental health status), with higher scores representing poorer behaviour. Two dietary patterns (Western and Healthy) were identified using factor analysis and food group intakes estimated by a 212-item food frequency questionnaire. Relationships between dietary patterns, food group intakes and",
