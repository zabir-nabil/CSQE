    "Hyperactivity is a term used to describe excessive levels of physical and mental activity. It is commonly associated with conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and can manifest as difficulty sitting still, impulsivity, and a constant need for movement or stimulation. People with hyperactivity may struggle with focusing on tasks, controlling their impulses, and maintaining attention for extended periods of time. Treatment options for hyperactivity typically involve a combination of behavioral therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",
    "Hyperactivity is a term used to describe excessive levels of activity and movement in individuals. It is often associated with conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and can manifest as an inability to stay still, impulsive behavior, and difficulty focusing on tasks. Children with hyperactivity may have trouble sitting still in class, following instructions, and engaging in quiet activities. Treatment for hyperactivity may include behavioral therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. It is important for individuals with hyperactivity to receive proper support and understanding to help them navigate daily challenges and thrive in their environments."

    "Artificial food dyes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\tAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common behavioral disorders in children. Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, and inattention. While the biological pathways leading to ADHD are not clearly delineated, a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disorder are recognized. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. As a result",
    "Synthetic Food Colors and Neurobehavioral Hazards: The View from Environmental Health Research\tBackground: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive.

METHODS: 153 3-year-old and 144 8/9-year-old children were included in the study. The challenge drink contained sodium benzoate and one of two AFCA mixes (A or B) or a placebo mix.

    "Cardioprotective properties of kiwifruit.\tBeneficial effects of consumption of fruit and vegetables on the cardiovascular system have been reported. Fruit and vegetable components affect the cardiovascular system in both antioxidant and nonantioxidant ways. The mechanisms of their actions are, however, still not well understood. The compounds present in fruits and vegetables may function individually or in concert to protect lipoproteins and vascular cells from oxidation or by other mechanisms such as reducing plasma lipid levels, high blood pressure, and platelet hyperactivity. Emerging data indicate that kiwifruit is beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, as consumption of two or three fruit per day for 28 days or more lowers platelet hyperactivity, plasma lipids, and blood",
    "The effects of physical activity on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms: the evidence.\tEvidence supports the beneficial effects of physical activity (PA) on cognitive performance and suggests that effects might be particularly large for children. However, limited research has explored PA as a means of managing behavioral symptoms and improving cognitive performance of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The etiology of ADHD and the putative mechanisms for the effects of PA on cognitive performance suggest that PA might be especially important for this population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the literature regarding the potential of PA for ADHD symptom management, particularly in regard to behavioral and cognitive symptoms.",
    "Phthalates exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in school-age children.\tBACKGROUND: Very few studies have examined the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and phthalate exposure in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of phthalates on symptoms of ADHD in school-age children. METHODS: A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on measures of ADHD symptoms and neuropsychological dysfunction with regard to attention and impulsivity were obtained from 261 Korean children, age 8-11 years.

Objective To examine the association between the concentrations of urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OPs and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children age 8 to 15 years. Participants and Methods Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2000\u20132004) were available for 1,139 children representative of the general U.S. population. A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, based",

METHODS: Large prescription databases (the IMS Vector One: National and Total Patient Tracker) were used to examine national drug utilization patterns for the US pediatric population (ages 0-17 years) from 2002 through 2010. RESULTS: In 2010, a total of 263.6 million prescriptions were dispensed to the US pediatric population, 7% lower than in 2002, while prescriptions dispensed to the adult population increased 22% during the same time.",

    "Dietary components and human platelet activity.\tPlatelet hyperactivity is one of the most important factors responsible for the incidence of cardiovascular disease. There are many nutritive and non-nutritive compounds present in the diet which may affect platelet function in various ways. Recent discovery of anti-platelet factors in plants, vegetables and fruits provides a new dietary means for a long-term strategy to favorably modify human blood platelet activity. This review summarises the effects of these dietary components on human platelet function both in vitro and in vivo."
