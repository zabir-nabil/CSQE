    "Titanium dioxide is a common additive used in various industries, including food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. While it is generally regarded as safe for consumption and use in products, there have been concerns raised about its potential health effects when inhaled in large amounts. Some studies have suggested that titanium dioxide nanoparticles may have adverse effects on lung health when inhaled over an extended period.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable to limit exposure to titanium dioxide in its nanoparticle form, especially in products that are sprayed or inhaled, such as certain sunscreens and some food products. However, titanium dioxide in its larger particle form is considered safe for use in most consumer products when used in accordance with regulatory guidelines.\n\nUltimately, the decision to avoid titanium dioxide may depend on individual sensitivity and concerns regarding potential health risks. It is always recommended to consult with healthcare professionals and to follow labeling instructions on products containing titanium dioxide to make an informed choice.",
    "As with any substance, the decision to avoid titanium dioxide depends on numerous factors. Titanium dioxide is a common additive used in a wide range of products, including food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, due to its ability to provide color, opacity, and UV protection. However, there have been concerns raised about potential health risks associated with titanium dioxide consumption, particularly in its nanoparticle form.\n\nSome studies suggest that inhaling titanium dioxide nanoparticles may lead to respiratory issues and inflammation in the lungs. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for titanium dioxide nanoparticles to penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream, although research in this area is ongoing. While the overall safety of titanium dioxide is still debated, some regulatory bodies have imposed restrictions on its use in certain products.\n\nUltimately, individuals may choose to avoid products containing titanium dioxide based on their personal health preferences and risk tolerance.

    "Should We Avoid Titanium Dioxide? Titanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products. The foods with the highest content of TiO2 included candies, sweets, and chewing gums. Dietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages. Recent data suggest that more than 10^12 ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. One such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters. Fourteen of these were given provocation tests by drinking, on separate occasions of sulphur dioxide, sodium benzoate, and tartrazine, which are present in all orange drinks.",

    "Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles in Food and Personal Care Products\tTitanium dioxide is a common additive in many food, personal care, and other consumer products used by people, which after use can enter the sewage system, and subsequently enter the environment as treated effluent discharged to surface waters or biosolids applied to agricultural land, incinerated wastes, or landfill solids. This study quantifies the amount of titanium in common food products, derives estimates of human exposure to dietary (nano-) TiO2, and discusses the impact of the nanoscale fraction of TiO2 entering the environment. The foods with the highest content of TiO2 included candies, sweets and chewing gums. Among personal care products, toothpastes and select",
    "Diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.\tBACKGROUND: A better understanding of the environmental factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease should help to prevent occurrence of the disease and its relapses. AIM: To review current knowledge on dietary risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: The PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for studies on diet and risk of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Established non-diet risk factors include family predisposition, smoking, appendectomy, and antibiotics. Retrospective case-control studies are encumbered with methodological problems. Prospective studies on European cohorts, mainly including middle-aged adults, suggest that a diet high in protein from meat and fish is associated",
    "Dietary microparticles and their impact on tolerance and immune responsiveness of the gastrointestinal tract\tDietary microparticles are non-biological bacterial-sized particles of the gastrointestinal lumen that occur due to endogenous formation (calcium phosphate) or following oral exposure (exogenous microparticle). In the UK, about 40 mg (1012) of exogenous microparticles are ingested per person per day, through exposure to food additives, pharmaceutical/supplement excipients or toothpaste constituents. Once ingested, exogenous microparticles are unlikely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without adsorbing to their surfaces some ions and molecules of the intestinal lumen. Both entropy and ionic attraction drive such interactions. Calcium ions are especially well adsorbed by dietary microparticles which",
    "Dietary sources of inorganic microparticles and their intake in healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's disease.\tDietary microparticles are non-biological, bacterial-sized particles. Endogenous sources are derived from intestinal Ca and phosphate secretion. Exogenous sources are mainly titanium dioxide (TiO2) and mixed silicates (Psil); they are resistant to degradation and accumulate in human Peyer's patch macrophages and there is some evidence that they exacerbate inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). However, whether their intake differs between those with and without CD has not been studied. We aimed to identify dietary microparticle sources and intakes in subjects with and without CD. Patients with inactive CD and matched general",
    "Immune potentiation of ultrafine dietary particles in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\tVarious specific and non-specific environmental factors have been associated with the induction and/or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. One such factor is the potential role of ingested ultrafine particles. In fact, based on a Western diet, recent data suggest that more than 10(12)ultrafine particles are ingested per person every day. These microparticles have been considered inert although they adsorb endogenous constituents of the intestinal lumen and are taken up by human intestinal lymphoid aggregates. Based on these observations, we determined whether one such dietary microparticle, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), alters",
    "Evaluation of certain food additives. Seventy-first report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.\tThis report represents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, with a view to recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to preparing specifications for identity and purity. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation and assessment of intake of food additives. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of technical, toxicological and intake data for certain food additives: branching glycosyltransferase from Rhodothermus obamensis expressed in Bacillus subtilis, cassia gum, cyclamic acid and its",
    "Asthma induced by sulphur dioxide, benzoate and tartrazine contained in orange drinks.\tOf 272 patients with asthma, thirty (11%) gave a history of exacerbations occurring after ingestion, solutions of orange orange drinks. Fourteen of these were given provocation tests by drinking, on separate occasions of sulphur dioxide, sodium benzoate and tartrazine, which are present in all orange drinks. Eight reacted to sulphur dioxide with a fall in FEV1, four to sodium benzoate and one to tartrazine, and four did not react to any of these agents. Three of the benzoate patients were also sensitive to sulphur dioxide. The sulphur dioxide sensitive patients were predominantly young, with extrinsic asthma. The",
    "Complementary feeding: a commentary by the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition.\tThis position paper on complementary feeding summarizes evidence for health effects of complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. Complementary feeding (ie, solid foods and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants",
    "[Floppy baby with macrocytic anemia and vegan mother].\tWe report the case of a 7 month-old girl that presented with acute anemia, generalized muscular hypotonia and failure to thrive. Laboratory evaluation revealed cobalamin deficiency, due to a vegan diet of the mother. The clinical triad of an acquired floppy baby syndrome with megaloblastic anemia and failure to thrive is pathognomic for infantile cobalamin deficiency. Neurological abnormalities are often irreversible and may be associated with delayed myelinization in the MRI. A normal cobalamin level in maternal serum and absence of anemia do not exclude subclinical deficiency. If cobalamin deficiency is suspected, e.g. in pregnant women on vegan diet, urinary methylmalonic acid excretion and plasma",
    "Heavy metals in commercial fish in New Jersey.\tLevels of contaminants in fish are of particular interest because of the potential risk to humans who consume them. While attention has focused on self-caught fish, most of the fish eaten by the American public comes from commercial sources. We sampled 11 types of fish and shellfish obtained from supermarkets and specialty fish markets in New Jersey and analyzed them for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, and selenium. We test the null hypothesis that metal levels do not vary among fish types, and we consider whether the levels of any metals could harm the fish themselves or their predators or pose a health risk"
