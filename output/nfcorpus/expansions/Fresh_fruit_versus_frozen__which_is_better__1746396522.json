    "When comparing fresh fruit to frozen fruit, there are factors to consider to determine which is better suited for your needs. Fresh fruit is known for its vibrant colors, textures, and flavors, being at its peak when just harvested. However, fresh fruit may be more perishable and have a limited shelf life, resulting in potential food waste if not consumed promptly. On the other hand, frozen fruit is harvested at its peak ripeness and then frozen quickly to preserve its nutrients and flavors. Frozen fruit is convenient, can be stored for longer periods, and is often more affordable than fresh fruit, especially when certain fruits are out of season. Both fresh and frozen fruit can be nutritious options, but the choice between the two ultimately depends on personal preferences, convenience, and specific dietary needs.",
    "The debate between fresh fruit and frozen fruit often revolves around the question of which is better in terms of nutrition and taste. Fresh fruit is prized for its natural flavor and texture, as well as the perception that it contains higher levels of vitamins and antioxidants. However, frozen fruit offers its own set of advantages. Frozen fruit is typically picked at peak ripeness and immediately frozen, locking in nutrients and flavor. It is also convenient, readily available year-round, and often more affordable than fresh fruit, especially when certain fruits are not in season. In the end, both fresh and frozen fruit can be healthy choices, offering a variety of essential nutrients and health benefits. Ultimately, the best choice may depend on personal preference, seasonal availability, and individual needs for convenience and cost."

    "Fresh fruit versus frozen--which is better? The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. We compared the bioavailability and metabolism of sulforaphane from portions of lightly cooked fresh or frozen broccoli. Sulforaphane bioavailability was about tenfold higher for the soups made from fresh. The present study was conducted to determine differences in antioxidant levels of fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried strawberries, and strawberry jam. We previously showed that several commercially available frozen broccoli products do not retain the ability to generate the cancer-preventative agent sulforaphane. We hypothesized that this was because the necessary hydrolyzing enzyme myrosinase was destroyed during blanching, as part of the processing that frozen broccoli undergoes.",
    "Fresh fruit versus frozen--which is better? Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics. The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing.

    "Effect of freezing and storage on the phenolics, ellagitannins, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of red raspberries.\tScottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after",
    "Isothiocyanate concentrations and interconversion of sulforaphane to erucin in human subjects after consumption of commercial frozen broccoli compa...\tSCOPE: Sulforaphane (a potent anticarcinogenic isothiocyanate derived from glucoraphanin) is widely considered responsible for the protective effects of broccoli consumption. Broccoli is typically purchased fresh or frozen and cooked before consumption. We compared the bioavailability and metabolism of sulforaphane from portions of lightly cooked fresh or frozen broccoli, and investigated the bioconversion of sulforaphane to erucin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen healthy volunteers consumed broccoli soups produced from fresh or frozen broccoli florets that had been lightly cooked and sulforaphane thio-conjugates quantified in plasma and urine. Sulforaphane bioavailability was about tenfold higher for the soups made from fresh",
    "Differences in antioxidant levels of fresh, frozen and freeze-dried strawberries and strawberry jam.\tThe present study was conducted to determine differences in antioxidant levels of fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried strawberries, and strawberry jam. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity (HAA) and lipophilic antioxidant activity (LAA) were measured using the ABTS/H\u2082O\u2082/HRP decoloration method. HAA and LAA were then summed to calculate the total antioxidant activity (TAA). Mean differences in HAA and LAA were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's T3 pairwise comparisons. The mean TAA for freeze-dried strawberries based on an 'as consumed' weight (95% confidence interval [CI",
    "Microbiological quality of sushi from sushi bars and retailers.\tSushi is a traditional Japanese food, mostly consisting of rice and raw fish. Fish is considered a healthy food, but as with other animal products, consumption of raw muscle incurs potential health risks such as ingestion of pathogenic bacteria or parasites. In this study, 250 sushi samples were analyzed for their microbiological status and the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria. A comparison was made between frozen sushi from supermarkets and fresh sushi from sushi bars. Aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts differed for sushi from these two sources, with means of 2.7 log CFU/g for frozen sushi and 6.3 log CFU/g for fresh sushi. The prevalence",
    "Processed tart cherry products--comparative phytochemical content, in vitro antioxidant capacity and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity.\tProcessing of fruits and vegetables affects their phytochemical and nutrient content. Tart cherries are commercially promoted to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. However, processing affects their phytochemical content and may affect their related health benefits. The current study compares the in vitro antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase activity of processed tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) products-cherry juice concentrate, individually quick-frozen cherries, canned cherries, and dried cherries. Cherry products were analyzed for total anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content and profile. On a per serving basis, total anthocyanins were highest",
    "Modifying the processing and handling of frozen broccoli for increased sulforaphane formation.\tFrozen broccoli can provide a cheaper product, with a longer shelf life and less preparation time than fresh broccoli. We previously showed that several commercially available frozen broccoli products do not retain the ability to generate the cancer-preventative agent sulforaphane. We hypothesized that this was because the necessary hydrolyzing enzyme myrosinase was destroyed during blanching, as part of the processing that frozen broccoli undergoes. This study was carried out to determine a way to overcome loss of hydrolyzing activity. Industrial blanching usually aims to inactivate peroxidase, although lipoxygenase plays a greater role in product degradation during frozen storage of broccoli. Blanching at 86 \u00b0",
    "Gerson regimen.\tThe Gerson regimen, developed by Max Gerson in the 1930s, is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. It involves consuming fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices, eliminating salt from the diet, taking supplements such as potassium, vitamin B12, thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes, and detoxifying liver with coffee enemas to stimulate metabolism. Gerson therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and processed food, which changes its sodium and potassium content. It emphasizes increasing potassium intake and minimizing sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver. The coffee enemas are",
    "Postprandial glycemic response to orange juice and nondiet cola: is there a difference?\tThe purpose of this study was to compare the effects of unsweetened fruit juice and regular, decaffeinated soda on postprandial serum glucose levels in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) when these liquids are ingested separately as part of mixed meals. Eighteen individuals with NIDDM consumed three test breakfasts calculated using the diabetic exchange meal-planning system. Foods were identical in each of the breakfasts except for foods in the fruit exchange. Carbohydrate-equivalent amounts of fresh orange slices, unsweetened orange juice, and regular, decaffeinated Coke were consumed in breakfasts 1, 2, and 3,",
    "The association between dietary patterns and mental health in early adolescence.\tOBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between dietary patterns and mental health in early adolescence. METHOD: The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study is a prospective study of 2900 pregnancies recruited from 1989-1992. At 14 years of age (2003-2006; n=1324), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess behaviour (characterising mental health status), with higher scores representing poorer behaviour. Two dietary patterns (Western and Healthy) were identified using factor analysis and food group intakes estimated by a 212-item food frequency questionnaire. Relationships between dietary patterns, food group intakes and",
    "Detection and quantification of the antioxidant melatonin in Montmorency and Balaton tart cherries (Prunus cerasus).\tThe antioxidant melatonin was recently identified in a variety of edible plants and seeds in high concentrations. In plants, as in animals, melatonin is believed to function as a free radical scavenger and possibly in photoperiodism. In this study, melatonin was detected and quantified in fresh-frozen Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries (Prunus cerasus) using high-performance liquid chromatography. Both cherry species contain high levels of melatonin compared to the melatonin concentrations in the blood of mammals. Montmorency cherries (13.46 +/- 1.10 ng/g) contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do Balaton cherries"
