    "Apnea is a medical condition characterized by a temporary cessation of breathing during sleep. This interruption in breathing can occur multiple times throughout the night and may lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood. There are two main types of apnea: obstructive sleep apnea, which is caused by a blockage of the airway, and central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain fails to signal the muscles to breathe. Symptoms of apnea may include loud snoring, daytime fatigue, and waking up abruptly gasping for air. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have apnea, as it can lead to more serious health problems if left untreated. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, breathing devices, or surgery, depending on the underlying cause of the condition.",
    "Apnea is a medical condition characterized by the temporary cessation of breathing during sleep. This interruption in breathing can occur multiple times throughout the night and can result in decreased levels of oxygen in the blood. There are different types of apnea, including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and mixed apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common form, where the airway becomes blocked, leading to pauses in breathing. Symptoms of apnea may include loud snoring, gasping for air during sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and morning headaches. Treatment options for apnea may include lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and avoiding alcohol before bedtime, the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, or surgery in some cases. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of apnea, as untreated apnea can lead to serious health complications."
