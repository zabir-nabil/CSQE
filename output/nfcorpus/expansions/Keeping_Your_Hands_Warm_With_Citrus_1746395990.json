    "A systematic review of waist-to-height ratio as a screening tool for the prediction of cardiovascular disease and diabetes: 0\u00b75 could be a suitable...\tThis systematic review collated seventy-eight studies exploring waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist circumference (WC) or BMI as predictors of diabetes and CVD, published in English between 1950 and 2008. Twenty-two prospective analyses showed that WHtR and WC were significant predictors of these cardiometabolic outcomes more often than BMI, with similar OR, sometimes being significant predictors after adjustment for BMI. Observations from cross-sectional analyses, forty-four in adults, thirteen in children, supported these predictions. Receiver",
    "Cross-contamination versus undercooking of poultry meat or eggs - which risks need to be managed first?\tEpidemiological studies show that poultry meat and eggs are important sources for consumers' exposure to pathogens such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. There is a focus in many countries to reduce the level of human illness from food-borne pathogens. Reduction of the prevalence of contaminated poultry meat or eggs is one major area of focus. The other is risk communication to the consumer, where information aimed at changing the food preparation behaviour has been utilised as a risk management tool. The efficacy of messages such as 'cook poultry meat and eggs thoroughly' or 'wash your hands' will",
    "Diet and gallbladder cancer: a case-control study.\tCancer of the gallbladder is rare but fatal, and has an unusual geographic and demographic distribution. Gallstones and obesity have been suggested as possible risk factors. As diet is known to influence both these factors, we carried out the present study to evaluate the possible role of diet in gallbladder carcinogenesis. A case-control study involving 64 newly diagnosed cases of gallbladder cancer and 101 cases of gallstones was carried out. The dietary evaluation was carried out by the dietary recall method based on a preset questionnaire developed specifically for the present study, keeping in mind the common dietary habits prevailing in this part of the world.",
    "Citrus limonoids: analysis, bioactivity, and biomedical prospects.\tLimonoids are a prominent group of secondary metabolites in citrus fruit. The bitter character of some compounds in this group has historically compromised the quality of citrus fruit and juice. Detecting bitter limonoids in citrus, understanding their origins, and developing methods for their removal from citrus juices have provided the basis for citrus limonoid research. Evaluation of the biological activity of citrus limonoids has indicated the potential of these compounds to improve human health as anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, and antiviral agents. This review chronicles the evolution of citrus limonoid research from defining their participation in citrus bitterness to their potential utilization as important contributors to improving human",
    "Neuroprotective effects of citrus flavonoids.\tRecent attention has been given to the influence of dietary factors on health and mental well-being. Oxidative stress is associated with many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Dietary flavonoids exert cardioprotective, chemopreventive, and neuroprotective effects. The biological activities of flavonoids have been attributed to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and signaling properties. A clear understanding of the mechanisms of action, as either antioxidants or signaling molecules, is crucial for the application of flavonoids as interventions in neurodegeneration and as brain foods. Citrus flavonoids exert little adverse effect and have low or no cytotoxicity to healthy, normal cells. The main citrus flavonoids can also traverse the blood-",
    "Epidemiologic Investigation of Immune-Mediated Polyradiculoneuropathy among Abattoir Workers Exposed to Porcine Brain\tBackground In October 2007, a cluster of patients experiencing a novel polyradiculoneuropathy was identified at a pork abattoir (Plant A). Patients worked in the primary carcass processing area (warm room); the majority processed severed heads (head-table). An investigation was initiated to determine risk factors for illness. Methods and Results Symptoms of the reported patients were unlike previously described occupational associated illnesses. A case-control study was conducted at Plant A. A case was defined as evidence of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and compatible electrodiagnostic testing in a pork abattoir worker. Two control groups were used - randomly",
    "Nonpungent capsaicin analogs (capsinoids) increase energy expenditure through the activation of brown adipose tissue in humans.\tBACKGROUND: Capsinoids-nonpungent capsaicin analogs-are known to activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure (EE) in small rodents. BAT activity can be assessed by [\u00b9\u2078F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in humans. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the current study were to examine the acute effects of capsinoid ingestion on EE and to analyze its relation to BAT activity in humans.

    "The effect of blood removal on oxidation and shelf life of broiler breast meat.\tBlood components, especially hemoglobin, are powerful promoters of lipid oxidation and may decrease the shelf life of meat products. Therefore, this study examined different slaughter techniques to determine their effects on pH (24 h), color (L*a*b* values at 24 h), lipid oxidation, residual hemoglobin concentration (24 h), and sensory evaluation (d 1 and 4 postmortem; PM) in broiler breast fillets. The treatments included 1) CO(2) slaughter and not bled, 2) no stunning and bled, 3) electrical stunning (ES) and bled, 4) CO(2)",
    "Grape juice, but not orange juice or grapefruit juice, inhibits human platelet aggregation.\tCoronary artery disease is responsible for much mortality and morbidity around the world. Platelets are involved in atherosclerotic disease development and the reduction of platelet activity by medications reduces the incidence and severity of disease. Red wine and grapes contain polyphenolic compounds, including flavonoids, which can reduce platelet aggregation and have been associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Citrus fruits contain different classes of polyphenolics that may not share the same properties. This study evaluated whether commercial grape, orange and grapefruit juices, taken daily, reduce ex vivo platelet activity. In a randomized cross-over design, ten healthy human",
