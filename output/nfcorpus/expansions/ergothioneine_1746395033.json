    "Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring antioxidant that is found in certain foods such as mushrooms, beans, and oat bran. It is known for its ability to help protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. Research suggests that ergothioneine may play a role in maintaining overall health and supporting the immune system. Including ergothioneine-rich foods in your diet can be a beneficial way to boost your antioxidant intake and promote cellular health.",
    "Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a potent antioxidant in the human body. It is predominantly found in mushrooms, as well as in certain types of beans and grains. Ergothioneine has been shown to help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals and oxidative stress, which can contribute to various health conditions such as inflammation, aging, and chronic diseases. Additionally, ergothioneine has been studied for its potential benefits in supporting immune function and promoting overall well-being. Consuming a diet rich in ergothioneine-containing foods may help maintain optimal health and protect against cellular damage."

    "Dietary sources and antioxidant effects of ergothioneine.\tErgothioneine is a native membrane-impermeable thiol compound that is specifically accumulated in cells via the organic cation transporter OCTN1. In humans, OCTN1 and ergothioneine have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. However, available evidence about dietary sources and the functional role of ergothioneine in human physiology is scarce. Here, we analyzed the ergothioneine content in common foods using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we assessed the protective potency of ergothioneine against various oxidative stressors in OCTN1-expressing cells in comparison with the main intracellular thiol antioxidant glutathione by evaluating cell viability with the MTT reduction assay. Only some food contained ergothioneine with highest"
