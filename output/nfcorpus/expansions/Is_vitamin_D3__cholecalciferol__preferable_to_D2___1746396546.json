    "Vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal health, particularly in supporting bone health and immune function. When it comes to choosing between vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and D2 (ergocalciferol), research suggests that D3 is generally considered to be more effective and preferable. Vitamin D3 is the form naturally produced in the skin in response to sunlight, making it more bioavailable and easier for the body to utilize compared to D2. Studies have shown that D3 is more potent at raising and maintaining blood levels of vitamin D, which is important for overall health. Therefore, when looking to supplement with vitamin D, opting for vitamin D3 may offer greater benefits and be the preferable choice.",
    "When comparing vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to D2 (ergocalciferol), many experts consider D3 to be the preferable form of vitamin D. This preference is due to the fact that vitamin D3 is believed to be more effective at raising and maintaining blood levels of vitamin D in the body compared to D2. Additionally, vitamin D3 is the form of vitamin D naturally produced by the human body when skin is exposed to sunlight. However, both forms of vitamin D are commonly used in supplements and fortified foods, and some individuals may respond differently to each form. Ultimately, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most suitable form of vitamin D for individual health needs."

    "Is vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) preferable to D2 (ergocalciferol)? Vitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3. An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Currently, there is a lack of clarity in the literature as to whether there is a definitive difference between the effects of vitamins D2 and D3 in the raising of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The objective of this article was to report a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have directly compared the effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on serum 25(OH)D concentrations in humans. Current unitage for the calciferols suggests that equimolar quantities of vitamins D2 (D2) and D3 (D3) are biologically equivalent. The aim of the study was to compare the potencies of D2 and D3.",

    "Low Vitamin D Status: Definition, Prevalence, Consequences and Correction\tVitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3. An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Though controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be ~30-32 ng/ml or above. Using this definition, it has been is estimated that approximately three quarters of all adults in the United States are low. Classically,",
    "Ergocalciferol from mushrooms or supplements consumed with a standard meal increases 25-hydroxyergocalciferol but decreases 25-hydroxycholecalcifer...\tFew foods contain ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. Treatment of mushrooms with UV light increases ergocalciferol content and could provide a dietary source of vitamin D. We evaluated the impact of consuming UV-treated white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) on the vitamin D status of healthy adults. Thirty-eight volunteers were randomized to 4 treatments consumed with a standard meal for 6 wk: the control (C) group received untreated mushrooms providing 0.85 \u03bcg/d ergocalciferol (n = 10); groups M1 and M2 received UV-treated mushrooms providing 8.8 (n = 10) and 17.1",
    "Comparison of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status: a systematic review and meta-analysis\tBackground: Currently, there is a lack of clarity in the literature as to whether there is a definitive difference between the effects of vitamins D2 and D3 in the raising of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D].
