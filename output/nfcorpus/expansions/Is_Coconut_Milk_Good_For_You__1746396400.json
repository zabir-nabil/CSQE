    "Coconut milk is a popular dairy alternative that is enjoyed by many people around the world. It is rich, creamy, and adds a unique flavor to both sweet and savory dishes. In terms of nutrition, coconut milk contains various vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, E, B vitamins, iron, and magnesium. However, it is also high in saturated fats, which may not be ideal for those watching their fat intake. \n\nThe health benefits of coconut milk include its potential to boost heart health, improve digestion, maintain healthy skin and hair, and provide a source of quick energy. Additionally, coconut milk is lactose-free and suitable for individuals with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies.\n\nIt is important to consume coconut milk in moderation due to its high saturated fat content. Opt for unsweetened varieties to avoid added sugars. Overall, adding coconut milk to your diet can be beneficial when enjoyed as part of a balanced and varied eating plan.",
    "Coconut milk is a popular dairy alternative that is known for its rich flavor and creamy texture. While it can be a delicious addition to many dishes, whether or not coconut milk is good for you depends on your individual dietary needs and goals. \n\nCoconut milk is high in saturated fat, which can raise cholesterol levels if consumed in excess. However, it also contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are a type of healthy fat that may provide some health benefits, such as aiding in weight management and supporting heart health.\n\nIf you are looking to reduce your saturated fat intake, it's important to consume coconut milk in moderation and opt for light or reduced-fat versions when possible. Additionally, be mindful of added sugars in sweetened varieties of coconut milk.\n\nOverall, coconut milk can be a flavorful and satisfying addition to your diet when consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced eating plan.

    "The cholesterol-lowering effect of coconut flakes in humans with moderately raised serum cholesterol.\tThis study investigated the effect of coconut flakes on serum cholesterol levels of humans with moderately raised serum cholesterol in 21 subjects. The serum total cholesterol of subjects differed and ranged from 259 to 283 mg/dL. The study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover design on a 14-week period, consisting of four 2-week experimental periods, with each experimental period separated by a 2-week washout period. The test foods were as follows: corn flakes as the control food, oat bran flakes as the reference food, and corn flakes with 15% and 25%",
    "Dietary intake and the risk of coronary heart disease among the coconut-consuming Minangkabau in West Sumatra, Indonesia.\tSeveral nutrition and non-nutritional pathways are recognised in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. However, several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut, a source of saturated fat. A case-control study was conducted among the Minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between the coronary cases and",
    "Viscous versus nonviscous soluble fiber supplements: mechanisms and evidence for fiber-specific health benefits.\tPURPOSE: This review focuses on the health benefits of viscous versus nonviscous soluble fibers, why symptoms can occur with increased fiber consumption, and how to avoid symptoms to improve adherence with a high-fiber diet. DATA SOURCES: Review of scientific literature as well as evidence-based guidelines and resources. CONCLUSIONS: While it is generally known that \"fiber is good for you,\" it is less well known that specific health benefits are associated with specific fiber characteristics. Many of the health benefits of fiber can be directly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers when hydrated (i.e.",
    "Antioxidant status in humans after consumption of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) juices with and without defatted milk.\tThe present study was designed to evaluate the possible effect of the consumption of blackberry juices (BJ) prepared with water (BJW) and defatted milk (BJM) on the plasma antioxidant capacity and the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. A significant (p < 0.05) increase in the ascorbic acid content in the plasma was observed after intake of both BJs. However, no changes were observed in the plasma urate and alpha-tocopherol levels. An increase on the plasma antioxidant capacity, by ORAC assay, was observed only after consumption of BJW but not statistically significant.",
    "Coconut oil predicts a beneficial lipid profile in pre-menopausal women in the Philippines\tCoconut oil is a common edible oil in many countries, and there is mixed evidence for its effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. Here we examine the association between coconut oil consumption and lipid profiles in a cohort of 1,839 Filipino women (age 35\u201369 years) participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, a community based study in Metropolitan Cebu City. Coconut oil intake was measured as individual coconut oil intake calculated using two 24-hour dietary recalls (9.54 \u00b1 8.92 grams). Cholesterol profiles were measured in plasma samples collected after an overnight fast. Mean lipid values in",
    "Coconut oil enhances tomato carotenoid tissue accumulation compared to safflower oil in the Mongolian gerbil ( Meriones unguiculatus ).\tEvidence suggests that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats facilitate greater absorption of carotenoids than saturated fats. However, the comparison of consuming a polyunsaturated fat source versus a saturated fat source on tomato carotenoid bioaccumulation has not been examined. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of coconut oil and safflower oil on tomato carotenoid tissue accumulation in Mongolian gerbils ( Meriones unguiculatus ) fed a 20% fat diet. Coconut oil feeding increased carotenoid concentrations among many compartments including total carotenoids in the serum (p = 0.0003), adrenal glandular phytoene (p = 0.04), hepatic phytofluene",

Li et al. (2011) now show that specific dietary compounds present in cruciferous vegetables act through the AhR to promote intestinal immune function, revealing AhR as a critical link between diet and immunity.

    "Effects of dietary coconut oil, butter and safflower oil on plasma lipids, lipoproteins and lathosterol levels.\tOBJECTIVE: The aim of this present study was to determine plasma levels of lathosterol, lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins during diets rich in butter, coconut fat and safflower oil. DESIGN: The study consisted of sequential six week periods of diets rich in butter, coconut fat then safflower oil and measurements were made at baseline and at week 4 in each diet period. SUBJECTS: Forty-one healthy Pacific island polynesians living in New Zealand participated in the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were supplied with some foods rich in the test fats and were given detailed dietary advice which was",
    "The intravenous use of coconut water.\tMedical resources routinely used for intravenous hydration and resuscitation of critically ill patients may be limited in remote regions of the world. When faced with these shortages, physicians have had to improvise with the available resources, or simply do without. We report the successful use of coconut water as a short-term intravenous hydration fluid for a Solomon Island patient, a laboratory analysis of the local coconuts, and a review of previously documented intravenous coconut use.",

Comparison of flavan-3-ol content with nonfat co...\tA survey of a broad range of chocolate- and cocoa-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers, which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidins. Samples consisted of the three or four top-selling products within the following six categories: natural cocoa powder, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized for percent fat (% fat),"
