    "One important way to prevent strokes is by following a healthy diet. A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce the risk of strokes. Consuming foods that are high in saturated fats, salt, and added sugars can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions that can lead to strokes. Incorporating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and seeds, can also benefit heart health and lower the risk of strokes. Additionally, keeping hydrated by drinking plenty of water and limiting alcohol consumption can support overall vascular health and decrease the likelihood of experiencing a stroke. By making mindful choices in regards to dietary habits, individuals can take proactive steps in preventing strokes and promoting long-term wellness.",
    "Preventing strokes with diet is essential for maintaining optimal health and reducing the risk of this serious medical condition. Incorporating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and the risk of developing conditions that increase the likelihood of strokes. Avoiding foods high in saturated and trans fats, as well as excess salt and sugar, can also contribute to a healthier cardiovascular system. Additionally, staying hydrated, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol consumption are all important factors in preventing strokes through dietary choices. By prioritizing a balanced and nutritious diet, individuals can enhance their overall well-being and decrease the likelihood of experiencing a stroke in the future."

    "Preventing Strokes with Diet The combination of healthy lifestyle factors is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and total cardiovascular disease. We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index <25 kg/m^2, \u226530 minutes/day of moderate activity, consuming alcohol modestly... We examined the association between dietary TAC and stroke incidence in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free women and in women with CVD history at baseline. Consumption of antioxidant-rich foods may reduce the risk of stroke by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. In adjusted Cox models, high dietary fiber intake reduced the risk of stroke. This research aimed to clarify whether high dietary fiber intake has an impact on the incidence and risk of stroke at a population level.",
    "Preventing Strokes with Diet We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index <25 kg/m2, \u226530 minutes/day of moderate activity, consuming alcohol modestly (men: 5\u201330g; women: 5\u201315g alcohol). This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively synthesize all studies that examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke. Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression). We examined the association between dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and stroke incidence in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free women and in women with CVD history at baseline. In adjusted Cox models, high dietary fiber intake reduced the risk of stroke."

    "Primary prevention of stroke by healthy lifestyle\tBackground The combination of healthy lifestyle factors is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes and total cardiovascular disease. Little is known about the impact of multiple lifestyle factors on risk of stroke. Methods and results We conducted a prospective cohort study among 43,685 men from Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 71,243 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Diet and other lifestyle factors were updated from self-reported questionnaires. We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index <25 kg/m 2, \u226530 minutes/day of moderate activity, consuming alcohol modestly (men:5\u201330g; women:5\u201315g alcohol",
    "Mediterranean diet, stroke, cognitive impairment, and depression: A meta-analysis.\tOBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively synthesize all studies that examine the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke, depression, cognitive impairment, and Parkinson disease. METHODS: Potentially eligible publications were those providing effect estimates of relative risk (RR) for the association between Mediterranean diet and the aforementioned outcomes. Studies were sought in PubMed up to October 31, 2012. Maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted; separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherence. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression, and",
    "Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies\tObjectives To determine the quantitative efficacy of different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and who should receive treatment. Design Meta-analysis. Data source Medline (1966-2007). Study selection Randomised trials of blood pressure lowering drugs recording CHD events and strokes. 108 trials studied differences in blood pressure between study drug and placebo (or control group not receiving the study drug) (\u201cblood pressure difference trials\u201d), and 46 trials compared drugs (\u201c",
    "Prevention of diabetes and reduction in major cardiovascular events in studies of subjects with prediabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled...\tBACKGROUND: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are pre-diabetic states, treatment of which may prevent or delay the onset of overt diabetes and thus potentially reduce major cardiovascular (CV) events. We therefore sought to determine whether interventions (including diet, exercise and pharmacological therapy), altered all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality in such subjects. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were identified in the medical literature and databases. Trials were eligible for",
    "Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet.\tBACKGROUND: Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and,",
