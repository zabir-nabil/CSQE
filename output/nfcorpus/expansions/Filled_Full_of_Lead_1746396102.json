    "Relationship between saturated fatty acids and periodontal disease.\tSaturated fatty acids (SFAs) produce an inflammatory response. Hyperinflammation is now recognized as one of the key underlying etiologic factors in periodontal disease. The longitudinal relationship between dietary SFAs and periodontal disease in 264 Japanese individuals, aged 75 years, for whom data were available for the years 2003-2004, was investigated. SFA intake was assessed with a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Participants were classified by quartiles of SFA intake. Full-mouth periodontal status, measured as the clinical attachment level (CAL), was recorded at baseline and follow-up examinations. The number of teeth with a loss of CAL\u22653",
    "Hidden vegetables: an effective strategy to reduce energy intake and increase vegetable intake in adults\tBackground: The overconsumption of energy-dense foods leads to excessive energy intakes. The substitution of low-energy-dense vegetables for foods higher in energy density can help decrease energy intakes but may be difficult to implement if individuals dislike the taste of vegetables. Objective: We investigated whether incorporating pur\u00e9ed vegetables to decrease the energy density of entr\u00e9es at multiple meals reduced daily energy intakes and increased daily vegetable intakes. Design: In this crossover study, 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory once a week for 3 wk. Across conditions,",
    "Blood Harmane, Blood Lead, and Severity of Hand Tremor: Evidence of Additive Effects\tBackground Tremor is a widespread phenomenon in human populations. Environmental factors are likely to play an etiological role. Harmane (1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-\u03b2]indole) is a potent tremor-producing \u03b2-carboline alkaloid. Lead is another tremor-producing neurotoxicant. The effects of harmane and lead with respect to tremor have been studied in isolation. Objectives We tested the hypothesis that tremor would be particularly severe among individuals who had high blood concentrations of both of these toxicants. Methods Blood concentrations of harmane and lead were each quantified in 257 individuals (106 essential tremor cases and 151 controls)",

The Hg content also increases with maternal amalgam load in amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, meconium, various foetal tissues including liver, kidney and brain, in colostrum and breast milk.

    "Prevalence of Vitamin A Deficiency in South Asia: Causes, Outcomes, and Possible Remedies\tVitamin A deficiency (VAD) has been recognized as a public-health issue in developing countries. Economic constraints, sociocultural limitations, insufficient dietary intake, and poor absorption leading to depleted vitamin A stores in the body have been regarded as potential determinants of the prevalence of VAD in South Asian developing countries. VAD is exacerbated by lack of education, poor sanitation, absence of new legislation and enforcement of existing food laws, and week monitoring and surveillance system. Several recent estimates confirmed higher morbidly and mortality rate among children and pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing age. Xerophthalmia is",
    "Mercury in human hair as an indicator of the fish consumption.\tOBJECTIVES: Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and should be handled with care. It can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury. Fish have a natural tendency to accumulate mercury. Methylmercury is produced by microbial methylation of inorganic mercury in water sediment then it infiltrates the food chain and it consequently accumulates in fish. Fish are the main source of methylmercury in human food. Mercury is transferred into a hair; and this can be than used to monitor the long-term exposure to mercury.",
    "Dairy food intake in relation to semen quality and reproductive hormone levels among physically active young men\tSTUDY QUESTION Is increased consumption of dairy foods associated with lower semen quality? SUMMARY ANSWER We found that intake of full-fat dairy was inversely related to sperm motility and morphology. These associations were driven primarily by intake of cheese and were independent of overall dietary patterns. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY It has been suggested that environmental estrogens could be responsible for the putative secular decline in sperm counts. Dairy foods contain large amounts of estrogens. While some studies have suggested dairy as a possible contributing factor for decreased semen quality, this finding has not been consistent across studies. STUDY DESIGN,",
    "Differential effects of reproductive factors on the risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. Results from a large cohort of French women\tThe aim of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the role of hormonal factors in breast cancer risk and to determine whether the effect of reproductive events differs according to age at diagnosis. It analysed the effect of age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, number of full-term pregnancies and number of spontaneous abortions both on the overall risk of breast cancer and on its pre- or postmenopausal onset, using the data on 1718 breast cancer cases, obtained from a large sample of around 100\u200a000 French women participating in",
    "Veganism and its relationship with insulin resistance and intramyocellular lipid.\tOBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that dietary factors in the vegan diet lead to improved insulin sensitivity and lower intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) storage. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 24 vegans and 25 omnivores participated in this study; three vegan subjects could not be matched therefore the matched results are shown for 21 vegans and 25 omnivores. The subjects were matched for gender, age and body mass index (BMI). INTERVENTIONS: Full anthropometry, 7-day dietary assessment and physical activity levels were",
    "The emergence of \"lifestyle medicine\" as a structured approach for management of chronic disease.\tChronic diseases with a lifestyle-based aetiology currently make up a significant proportion of primary care consultations, but management often falls between the demands of public and clinical health. A modified clinical approach, based around the concept of \"lifestyle medicine\", helps fill the gap by adding behavioural, motivational and environmental skills to conventional medical practice. When used in a multidisciplinary setting, lifestyle medicine offers potential cost and effectiveness benefits, which are beginning to be realised."
