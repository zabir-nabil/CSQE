    "Vitamin D, often referred to as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. Recent research and evolving understanding of the importance of vitamin D have led to new recommendations regarding its intake and benefits. The latest guidelines emphasize the significance of adequate vitamin D levels in supporting bone health, immune function, and overall disease prevention.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind the updated recommendations is the recognition of the widespread prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among various populations. Insufficient exposure to sunlight, limited dietary intake, and certain health conditions can contribute to low vitamin D levels, underscoring the need for proper supplementation. Furthermore, studies have shown that maintaining optimal vitamin D levels may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancers.\n\nIn light of these findings, healthcare professionals are now encouraged to assess individual vitamin D needs based on factors such as age, ethnicity, geographic location, and lifestyle habits. Tailored recommendations for supplementation and sunlight exposure can help individuals achieve and maintain adequate vitamin D levels for optimal health.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolving landscape of vitamin D research has shed new light on the importance of this essential nutrient. By following the latest recommendations and incorporating suitable sources of vitamin D into daily routines, individuals can support their overall health and well-being in a proactive manner."

Vitamin D deficiency causes osteopenia and osteoporosis. The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency. Vitamin D was used to treat TB in the pre-antibiotic era, and its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has long been known to enhance the immune response to mycobacteria in vitro.

    "Safety considerations and potential interactions of vitamins: should vitamins be considered drugs?\tOBJECTIVE: To examine adverse effects, adverse events, and potential interactions of vitamins in light of their current prevalence of use, and to discuss whether vitamins should be considered over-the-counter drugs or natural health products/dietary supplements. DATA SOURCES: We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search, explored 4 online databases (Medline Plus, Drug Digest, Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database, and the database of the University of Maryland), and examined reference lists of included studies published from 1966 through October 2009. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The studies were reviewed, with an emphasis on randomized",
    "VITAMIN D: A D-LIGHTFUL SOLUTION FOR HEALTH\tThroughout evolution sunlight produced vitamin D in the skin has been critically important for health. Vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin, is actually a hormone. Once it is produced in the skin or ingested from the diet it is converted sequentially in the liver and kidneys to its biologically active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This hormone interacts with its receptor in the small intestine to increase the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption for the maintenance of the skeleton throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency during the first few years of life results in a flattened pelvis making it difficult for childbirth. Vitamin D deficiency causes osteopenia and osteoporosis",
    "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor and its xenobiotic ligands: a fundamental trigger for cardiovascular diseases.\tThis review reconsiders a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, tobacco smoking, as the activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), also known as the dioxin receptor, by aryl hydrocarbons from the tar fraction of tobacco in various organs of the cardiovascular domain. This concept sheds new light on well-known albeit controversial epidemiological concepts such as the Mediterranean diet and the French paradox. We also review the discovery that resveratrol, a natural AhR antagonist, may be of interest in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",
    "The effect of vegetarian diet on selected essential nutrients in children.\tINTRODUCTION: Vegetarian diets are considered to promote health and reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. It is also known that restriction or exclusion of animal foods may result in low intake of essential nutrients. The aim of the presented study was to assess the intake and serum status of vitamin B12, folate, vitamins A, E and D, as well as concentrations of homocysteine, total antioxidant status and iron balance in Polish vegetarian children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 50 children, aged 5-11 who had been referred to the Institute of Mother and Child for dietary consultation. From those,",
    "Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline.\tOBJECTIVE: The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency. PARTICIPANTS: The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical",
    "The Alkaline Diet: Is There Evidence That an Alkaline pH Diet Benefits Health?\tThis review looks at the role of an alkaline diet in health. Pubmed was searched looking for articles on pH, potential renal acid loads, bone health, muscle, growth hormone, back pain, vitamin D and chemotherapy. Many books written in the lay literature on the alkaline diet were also reviewed and evaluated in light of the published medical literature. There may be some value in considering an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases and further studies are warranted in this area of medicine.",
    "Old wine in new bottles: vitamin D in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis.\tTuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of mortality, responsible for 1\u00b768 million deaths worldwide in 2009. The global prevalence of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is estimated to be 32%, and this carries a 5-20% lifetime risk of reactivation disease. The emergence of drug-resistant organisms necessitates the development of new agents to enhance the response to antimicrobial therapy for active TB. Vitamin D was used to treat TB in the pre-antibiotic era, and its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, has long been known to enhance the immune response to mycobacteria in vitro.",
    "The Influence of Social Involvement, Neighborhood Aesthetics, and Community Garden Participation on Fruit and Vegetable Consumption\tObjectives. We considered the relationship between an urban adult population's fruit and vegetable consumption and several selected social and psychological processes, beneficial aesthetic experiences, and garden participation. Methods. We conducted a population-based survey representing 436 residents across 58 block groups in Denver, Colorado, from 2006 to 2007. We used multilevel statistical models to evaluate the survey data. Results. Neighborhood aesthetics, social involvement, and community garden participation were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable intake. Community gardeners consumed fruits and vegetables 5.7 times per day, compared with home gardeners (4.6 times per",

    "Towards prevention of vitamin D deficiency and beyond: knowledge gaps and research needs in vitamin D nutrition and public health.\tThe North American Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently published their report on dietary reference intakes (DRI) for Ca and vitamin D. The DRI committee's deliberations underpinning this most comprehensive report on vitamin D nutrition to date benefited hugely from a much expanded knowledge base in vitamin D over the last decade or more. However, since their release, the vitamin D DRI have been the subject of intense controversy, which is largely due to the persistence of fundamental knowledge gaps in vitamin D. These can be identified at the levels of exposure, metabolism, storage,"
