    "pork, Pork intake and human papillomavirus-related disease. From pig to pork: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the pork production chain. Pork, beef and chicken have similar effects on acute satiety and hormonal markers of appetite. Detection and quantification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones in retail meat products. International correlations suggest that pork intake is positively associated with the incidence of cervical cancer, a disease also related to HPV. Recurrent reports have documented that pig herds are an important reservoir for MRSA, specifically the livestock-associated sequence type 398. The effects of three different meat-containing breakfast meals (pork, beef, or chicken) on acute satiety and appetite regulatory hormones were compared. MRSA was isolated from 9.6% of pork, 5.6% of beef, and 1.2% of chicken samples.",

    "Transfer of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from retail pork products onto food contact surfaces and the potential for consumer exposure.\tMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a pathogen that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and has been isolated at low population numbers in retail meat products. The objectives of this study were to estimate the potential transfer of MRSA from contaminated retail pork products to food contact surfaces and to estimate the potential for human exposure to MRSA by contact with those contaminated surfaces. Pork loins, bacon, and fresh pork sausage were inoculated with a four-strain mixed MRSA culture over a range of populations from approximately 4 to 8 log, vacuum packaged",
    "Pork intake and human papillomavirus-related disease.\tClinical and ecological evidence supporting an association between human papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumors and dietary factors are presented. Abstinence from high intake of fried pork (600-1,000 g/day) was associated with regression of an urethral condyloma in a healthy 19-year-old man treated with interferon gamma. International correlations suggest that pork intake is positively associated with incidence of cervical cancer, a disease also related to HPV. Pork meat or dietary factors associated with pork meat consumption may be involved in the development of HPV-related diseases.",
    "From pig to pork: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the pork production chain.\tMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major global public health concern and could be a food safety issue. Recurrent reports have documented that pig herds are an important reservoir for MRSA, specifically the livestock-associated sequence type 398. The high prevalence of MRSA in pig primary production facilities and the frequent detection of MRSA of the same types in pork and pig meat products raise the question of underlying mechanisms behind the introduction and transmission of MRSA along the pork production chain. A comprehensive review of current literature on the worldwide presence of livestock-associated MRSA in various steps of the",
    "Anaphylaxis to pork kidney is related to IgE antibodies specific for galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose.\tBACKGROUND: Carbohydrate-specific IgE antibodies present on nonprimate mammalian proteins were incriminated recently in delayed meat anaphylaxis. The aim of this study was to explore whether anaphylaxis to mammalian kidney is also associated with galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (\u03b1Gal)-specific IgE. METHODS: Fourteen patients with anaphylaxis to pork or beef kidney underwent prick tests to meat and kidney. Some patients also underwent skin tests to Erbitux(\u00ae) (cetuximab). IgE antibodies to \u03b1Gal, swine urine proteins, beef and pork meat, serum albumin proteins, cat, and rFel d 1 were measured by ImmunoCAP(\u00ae)",
