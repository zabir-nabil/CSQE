    "Ultra-processed foods are food products that have been heavily processed through various methods, often containing a long list of ingredients, including artificial additives, preservatives, and flavorings. These foods typically undergo extensive processing to create a convenient and ready-to-eat product that is often high in refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Examples of ultra-processed foods include sugary drinks, packaged snacks, fast food, and frozen dinners. Consuming a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health conditions. It is important to limit the intake of ultra-processed foods and focus on consuming whole, minimally processed foods for better overall health and well-being.",
    "Ultra-processed foods refer to food products that have been heavily processed and typically contain a long list of artificial ingredients, preservatives, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats. These foods are often high in added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats while lacking in essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Examples of ultra-processed foods include sugary breakfast cereals, packaged snacks, fast food, and ready-to-eat meals. Consuming a diet high in ultra-processed foods has been linked to various health issues such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and even certain types of cancer. It is important to limit the intake of ultra-processed foods and instead focus on incorporating whole, minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet for better overall health and well-being."

The objective of this study is to review the toxicology of poppy seed foods regarding influence on opiate drug tests."

    "Profits and pandemics: prevention of harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink industries.\tThe 2011 UN high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) called for multisectoral action including with the private sector and industry. However, through the sale and promotion of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink (unhealthy commodities), transnational corporations are major drivers of global epidemics of NCDs. What role then should these industries have in NCD prevention and control? We emphasise the rise in sales of these unhealthy commodities in low-income and middle-income countries, and consider the common strategies that the transnational corporations use",
    "Effect of wheat bran on serum lipids: influence of particle size and wheat protein.\tOBJECTIVE: Wheat fiber appears to protect from cardiovascular disease despite its lack of consistent effect on serum lipids. We therefore wished to determine whether reported inconsistencies in the effect of wheat bran resulted from differences in particle size or its high gluten content. METHODS: Two studies were conducted. In one-month metabolic diets, 24 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed breads providing an additional 19 g/d dietary fiber as medium or ultra-fine wheat bran and extra protein (10% of energy as wheat gluten). In two-week ad libitum diets, 24 predominantly normolipidemic subjects consumed breakfast cereals providing",
    "Detection of the hepatotoxic microcystins in 36 kinds of cyanobacteria Spirulina food products in China.\tGel filtration chromatography, ultra-filtration, and solid-phase extraction silica gel clean-up were evaluated for their ability to remove microcystins selectively from extracts of cyanobacteria Spirulina samples after using the reversed-phase octadecylsilyl ODS cartridge for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The reversed-phase ODS cartridge/silica gel combination were effective and the optimal wash and elution conditions were: H(2)O (wash), 20% methanol in water (wash), and 90% methanol in water (elution) for the reversed-phase ODS",
    "Dietary patterns, food groups, and telomere length in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)\tBackground Telomere length reflects biological aging and may be influenced by environmental factors, including those that affect inflammatory processes. Objective With data from 840 white, black, and Hispanic adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we studied cross-sectional associations between telomere length and dietary patterns and foods and beverages that were associated with markers of inflammation. Design Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Length was calculated as the amount of telomeric DNA (T) divided by the amount of a single-copy control DNA (S) (T/",
    "Dietary pattern and depressive symptoms in middle age\tBackground Studies of diet and depression have focused primarily on individual nutrients. Aims To examine the association between dietary patterns and depression using an overall diet approach. Method Analyses were carried on data from 3486 participants (26.2% women, mean age 55.6 years) from the Whitehall II prospective cohort, in which two dietary patterns were identified: \u2018whole food\u2019 (heavily loaded by vegetables, fruits and fish) and \u2018processed food\u2019 (heavily loaded by sweetened desserts, fried food, processed meat, refined grains and high-fat dairy products). Self-reported depression was assessed 5 years later using the Center for Epidemiologic",
    "Anti-inflammatory effects of plant-based foods and of their constituents.\tInflammation is a pathological condition underlying a number of diseases including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases. In addition, healthy, obese subjects also express markers of inflammation in their blood. Diet provides a variety of nutrients as well as non-nutritive bioactive constituents which modulate immunomodulatory and inflammatory processes. Epidemiological data suggest that dietary patterns strongly affect inflammatory processes. Primarily the intake of fruit and vegetables as well as of whole wheat is inversely associated with the risk of inflammation. In addition to observational studies there are also data from human intervention studies suggesting an anti-inflammatory potential of these plant",
    "Application of Bayesian Techniques to Model the Burden of Human Salmonellosis Attributable to U.S. Food Commodities at the Point of Processing: Adaptation of a Danish Model\tMathematical models that estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to food commodities at specific points in the food chain may be useful to risk managers and policy makers to formulate public health goals, prioritize interventions, and document the effectiveness of mitigations aimed at reducing illness. Using human surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Salmonella testing data from U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service's regulatory programs, we developed a point-of-processing foodborne illness attribution model by adapting the",

    "Effects of Polyphosphate Additives on Campylobacter Survival in Processed Chicken Exudates\tCampylobacter spp. are responsible for a large number of the bacterial food poisoning cases worldwide. Despite being sensitive to oxygen and nutritionally fastidious, Campylobacter spp. are able to survive in food processing environments and reach consumers in sufficient numbers to cause disease. To investigate Campylobacter persistence on processed chicken, exudates from chickens produced for consumer sale were collected and sterilized. Two types of exudates from chicken products were collected: enhanced, where a marinade was added to the chickens during processing, and nonenhanced, where no additives were added during processing. Exudates from enhanced chicken products examined in this study contained a mixture of polyphosphates.",
    "Poppy seed foods and opiate drug testing--where are we today?\tSeeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids. The objective of this study is to review the toxicology of poppy seed foods regarding influence on opiate drug tests. Computer-assisted literature review resulted in 95 identified references. Normal poppy seed consumption is generally regarded as safe. During food processing, the morphine content is considerably reduced (up to 90%). The possibility of false-positive opiate drug tests after poppy food ingestion exists. There are no unambiguous markers available to differentiate poppy"
