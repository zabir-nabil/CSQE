    "An aneurysm is a serious condition characterized by a weakened and bulging artery wall. This weakening can cause the artery to balloon out or even burst, leading to potentially life-threatening consequences. Aneurysms can occur in various parts of the body, such as the brain, abdomen, or aorta. Risk factors for developing an aneurysm include high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, smoking, and a family history of the condition. Symptoms may vary depending on the location of the aneurysm but can include severe headaches, abdominal pain, vision changes, and neurological deficits. Treatment options typically focus on preventing the aneurysm from rupturing and can include medications, surgery, or endovascular techniques. Early detection and management are crucial in improving outcomes for individuals with aneurysms.",
    "An aneurysm is a serious health condition that involves a weakened or bulging area in the wall of an artery. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can lead to severe internal bleeding and potentially be life-threatening. Aneurysms can occur in various parts of the body, but they are most commonly found in the brain or the aorta. Risk factors for aneurysms include high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, smoking, and a family history of the condition. It is essential to monitor and manage any risk factors for aneurysms, and prompt medical attention is necessary if an aneurysm is suspected or diagnosed to prevent serious complications."

    "Aneurysm and Neurocysticercosis: Casual or Causal Relationship? Case Report and Review of the Literature\tFour cases of suggestive inflammatory aneurysms in patients with neurocysticercosis have been described. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm and had a casual relationship with neurocysticercosis. At surgery, a viable cysticercus without signs of inflammation or thickened leptomeninges was found in the distal position of the aneurysm. Postoperatively, the patient received albendazole and dextrochlorpheniramine. In the subsequent three years, the patient was asymptomatic and took drugs to prevent convulsion and arterial hypertension. The relationship between NCC and the presence of cerebral aneurysm is discussed",
    "Analysis of risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm in a cohort of more than 3 million individuals.\tBACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk. METHODS: We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We observed a positive association with increasing years of",
    "The Collateral Network Concept: A Reassessment of the Anatomy of Spinal Cord Perfusion\tOBJECTIVE Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. An anatomical study was undertaken. METHODS Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a low-viscosity acrylic resin at physiological pressures. After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopy"
