    "Flaxseeds have been a topic of interest in the realm of breast cancer research, specifically concerning their potential impact on survival rates. Clinical evidence suggests that flaxseeds may play a beneficial role in the survival of breast cancer patients. Studies have indicated that flaxseeds contain compounds known as lignans, which have been associated with reduced cancer cell growth and improved outcomes in breast cancer patients. Additionally, the omega-3 fatty acids found in flaxseeds have been linked to anti-inflammatory effects that may further support overall health and well-being during cancer treatment. While more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between flaxseeds and breast cancer survival, the current evidence suggests that incorporating flaxseeds into a balanced diet may be a potential factor in promoting positive outcomes for individuals battling breast cancer.",
    "In recent years, there have been numerous studies investigating the potential impact of flaxseeds on breast cancer survival. While research in this area is ongoing, some promising findings suggest that flaxseeds may have a positive effect on breast cancer outcomes.\n\nOne study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that breast cancer patients who consumed flaxseeds experienced a significant reduction in tumor growth rates compared to those who did not incorporate flaxseeds into their diet. Additionally, flaxseeds contain compounds called lignans, which have been shown to have anti-cancer properties and may play a role in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells.\n\nWhile more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between flaxseeds and breast cancer survival, incorporating these nutrient-rich seeds into a balanced diet may offer potential benefits for individuals affected by this disease. It is important for individuals to consult with their healthcare provider before making any significant dietary changes, especially when managing a serious health condition like breast cancer."

    "Flaxseeds & Breast Cancer Survival: Clinical Evidence, PURPOSE: Flaxseed, the richest source of mammalian lignan precursors, has previously been shown to reduce the growth of tumors in rats. This study examined, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers and urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. PURPOSE: To investigate the association between intake of flaxseed-the richest source of dietary lignans (a class of phytoestrogens)-and breast cancer risk. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between consumption of flaxseed and flax bread and breast cancer risk. Background: Lignans \u2013 oestrogenic substances present in various foods \u2013 are associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but not much is known regarding their effects on survival. In a follow-up study of 2653 postmenopausal breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005, vital status and causes of death were verified through the end of 2009. Dietary lignan intakes have been associated with reduced breast cancer risks; however, no previous studies have investigated whether lignan intake might be associated with breast cancer survival. We examined the association of dietary lignan intakes with survival in 1122 women with primary, incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Dietary lignan intakes have been associated with reduced breast cancer risks; however, no previous studies have investigated whether lignan intake might be associated with breast cancer survival.

    "Do phytoestrogens reduce the risk of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence? What clinicians need to know.\tOestrogen is an important determinant of breast cancer risk. Oestrogen-mimicking plant compounds called phytoestrogens can bind to oestrogen receptors and exert weak oestrogenic effects. Despite this activity, epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of breast cancer is lower in countries where the intake of phytoestrogens is high, implying that these compounds may reduce breast cancer risk, and possibly have an impact on survival. Isoflavones and lignans are the most common phytoestrogens in the diet. In this article, we present findings from human observational and intervention studies related to both isoflavone and lignan exposure and breast cancer risk and",

This study examined, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers and urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were randomized to daily intake of either a 25 g flaxseed-containing muffin (n = 19) or a control (placebo) muffin (n = 13). At the time of diagnosis and again at definitive surgery, tumor tissue was analyzed for the",
    "Diet and breast cancer: understanding risks and benefits.\tBACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Extensive research has been completed to evaluate the relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer risk and survival after breast cancer; however, a summary report with clinical inference is needed. Materials and METHODS: This review summarizes the current epidemiological and clinical trial evidence relating diet to breast cancer incidence, recurrence, survival, and mortality. The review includes emerging epidemiological studies that assess risk within breast cancer subtypes as well as a summary of previous and ongoing dietary intervention trials designed to modify breast cancer risk. RESULTS: The available literature suggests that",
    "Consumption of flaxseed, a rich source of lignans, is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.\tPURPOSE: To investigate the association between intake of flaxseed-the richest source of dietary lignans (a class of phytoestrogens)-and breast cancer risk. METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire was used to measure the consumption of flaxseed and flax bread by 2,999 women with breast cancer and 3,370 healthy control women who participated in the Ontario Women's Diet and Health Study (2002-2003). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between consumption of flaxseed and flax bread and breast cancer risk. Confounding by established and suspected breast cancer risk factors, as well as dietary factors, was assessed.",
    "Tamoxifen and Flaxseed Alter Angiogenesis Regulators in Normal Human Breast Tissue In Vivo\tThe incidence of breast cancer is increasing in the Western world and there is an urgent need for studies of the mechanisms of sex steroids in order to develop novel preventive strategies. Diet modifications may be among the means for breast cancer prevention. Angiogenesis, key in tumor progression, is regulated by the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, which are controlled in the extracellular space. Sampling of these molecules at their bioactive compartment is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to explore if tamoxifen, one of the most used anti-estrogen treatments for breast cancer affected some of the most important",
    "Can green tea do that? A literature review of the clinical evidence.\tOBJECTIVE: Habitual green tea consumption has long been associated with health benefits including chemoprevention and cardiovascular protection. This non-systematic literature review presents the clinical evidence to date. METHOD: A literature review of peer-reviewed articles on observational and interventional studies was conducted to include green tea, its extract or its purified polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Electronic databases searched included PubMed (1966-2009) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2008). RESULTS: Observational studies are inconclusive on the benefits of habitual consumption of green tea in the prevention of most cancers. However,",
    "Statin use after diagnosis of breast cancer and survival: a population-based cohort study.\tBACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that statins, particularly simvastatin, can prevent growth in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. We investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancer-specific, or all-cause, mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. METHODS: A cohort of 17,880 breast cancer patients, newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, was identified from English cancer registries (from the National Cancer Data Repository). This cohort was linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, providing prescription records, and to the Office of",
