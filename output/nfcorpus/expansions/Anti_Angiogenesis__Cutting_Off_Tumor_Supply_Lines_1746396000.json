    "Anti-angiogenesis is a promising approach in cancer treatment that involves disrupting the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to thrive. By inhibiting the formation of these blood vessels, known as angiogenesis, the supply lines feeding the tumor are effectively cut off. This strategy starves the tumor of oxygen and nutrients, limiting its ability to grow and spread.\n\nSeveral anti-angiogenic drugs have been developed to target specific molecules and signaling pathways involved in blood vessel formation. These drugs work by blocking the signals that promote angiogenesis, thereby hindering the tumor's ability to establish a network of blood vessels to support its growth.\n\nResearch has shown that anti-angiogenesis therapy can be effective in treating various types of cancer, either on its own or in combination with other treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. By disrupting the tumor's blood supply, anti-angiogenesis not only helps shrink tumors but also reduces the risk of metastasis and can improve overall patient outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of cutting off tumor supply lines through anti-angiogenesis represents a promising avenue in cancer therapy. By targeting the blood vessels that nourish tumors, this approach has the potential to significantly impact tumor growth and spread, offering new hope in the fight against cancer.",
    "Anti-angiogenesis is a promising approach in cancer treatment that focuses on inhibiting the formation of blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. By targeting the process of angiogenesis, which tumors rely on to obtain nutrients and oxygen, this strategy aims to cut off the tumor's supply lines and prevent its progression. Various drugs and therapies have been developed to specifically target angiogenesis and disrupt the intricate network of blood vessels that support tumor growth. By starving tumors of the vital resources they need to thrive, anti-angiogenesis therapy has the potential to effectively hinder cancer spread and improve patient outcomes. This innovative treatment approach offers new hope in the fight against cancer by undermining one of its key survival mechanisms."

    "Anti-Angiogenesis: Cutting Off Tumor Supply Lines A significant anticancer activity of the naturally occurring carbohydrate inositol hexaphosphate (IP(6)) has been reported against numerous cancer models.

    "Anti-angiogenic activity of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6).\tA significant anticancer activity of the naturally occurring carbohydrate inositol hexaphosphate (IP(6)) has been reported against numerous cancer models. Since tumors require angiogenesis for growth and metastasis, we hypothesize that IP(6) reduces tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis depends on the interaction between endothelial and tumor cells, we investigated the effect of IP(6) on both. IP(6) inhibited the proliferation and induced the differentiation of endothelial cells in vitro; the growth of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) evaluated by MTT proliferation assay was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) = 0.74 mM). The combination of IP(6",
    "Evidence for a human-specific mechanism for diet and antibody-mediated inflammation in carcinoma progression\tPatients with cancer have circulating heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal red cells via recognition of the mammalian cell surface sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which was long considered an oncofetal antigen in humans. However, humans are genetically deficient in Neu5Gc production and instead metabolically accumulate Neu5Gc from dietary sources, particularly red meats and milk products. Moreover, mice with a human-like defect showed no alternate pathway for Neu5Gc synthesis and even normal humans express anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. We show here that human tumors accumulate Neu5Gc that is covalently attached to multiple classes of glycans. The paradox",
    "Tamoxifen and Flaxseed Alter Angiogenesis Regulators in Normal Human Breast Tissue In Vivo\tThe incidence of breast cancer is increasing in the Western world and there is an urgent need for studies of the mechanisms of sex steroids in order to develop novel preventive strategies. Diet modifications may be among the means for breast cancer prevention. Angiogenesis, key in tumor progression, is regulated by the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, which are controlled in the extracellular space. Sampling of these molecules at their bioactive compartment is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to explore if tamoxifen, one of the most used anti-estrogen treatments for breast cancer affected some of the most important",
    "Flavonoids, a ubiquitous dietary phenolic subclass, exert extensive in vitro anti-invasive and in vivo anti-metastatic activities.\tCancer metastasis refers to the spread of cancer cells from the primary neoplasm to distant sites, where secondary tumors are formed, and is the major cause of death from cancer. Natural phytochemicals containing phenolic compounds have been widely demonstrated to have the capability to prevent cancer metastasis. Among phenolic compounds, flavonoids are a very large subclass, and they are abundant in food and nutraceuticals. The number of reports demonstrating that flavonoids are an effective natural inhibitor of cancer invasion and metastasis is increasing in the scientific literature.

    "Association between green tea consumption and tooth loss: cross-sectional results from the Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study.\tOBJECTIVE: To examine the association between green tea consumption and tooth loss. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study. Usable self-administered questionnaires about green tea consumption and tooth loss were returned from 25,078 persons (12,019 men and 13,059 women) aged 40 to 64 years in Japan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for tooth loss using 3 cut-off points of 10, 20, and 25 teeth relative to each category of green tea consumption. RESULTS: Consumption of > or =",
    "A tomato-rich diet is related to depressive symptoms among an elderly population aged 70 years and over: a population-based, cross-sectional analysis.\tBACKGROUND: Enhanced oxidative stress or defective anti-oxidant defenses are related to the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms. Lycopene is the most powerful antioxidant amongst the carotenoids. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between different vegetables, including tomatoes/tomato products (a major source of lycopene), and depressive symptoms in a community-based elderly population. METHODS: We analyzed a cross-sectional survey including 986 community-dwelling elderly Japanese individuals aged 70 years and older. Dietary intake was assessed using a",
    "High dietary fiber intake prevents stroke at a population level.\tBACKGROUND & AIMS: This research was aimed at clarifying whether high dietary fiber intake has an impact on incidence and risk of stroke at a population level. METHODS: In 1647 unselected subjects, dietary fiber intake (DFI) was detected in a 12-year population-based study, using other dietary variables, anagraphics, biometrics, blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, uricaemia, fibrinogenaemia, erytrosedimentation rate, diabetes, insulin resistance, smoking, pulmonary disease and left ventricular hypertrophy as covariables. RESULTS: In adjusted Cox models, high DFI reduced the risk of stroke. In analysis",
    "A wholly nutritional 'multifocal angiostatic therapy' for control of disseminated cancer.\tA great deal of effort is now being devoted to the development of new drugs that hopefully will control the spread of inoperable cancer by safely inhibiting tumor-evoked angiogenesis. However, there is growing evidence that certain practical nutritional measures have the potential to slow tumor angiogenesis, and it is reasonable to anticipate that, by combining several measures that work in distinct but complementary ways to impede the angiogenic process, a clinically useful 'multifocal angiostatic therapy' (MAT) might be devised. Several measures which might reasonably be included in such a protocol are discussed below, and include: a low-fat",
    "Insights into the beneficial effect of caloric/ dietary restriction for a healthy and prolonged life\tOver the last several years, new evidence has kept pouring in about the remarkable effect of caloric restriction (CR) on the conspicuous bedfellows- aging and cancer. Through the use of various animal models, it is now well established that by reducing calorie intake one can not only increase life span but, also, lower the risk of various age related diseases such as cancer. Cancer cells are believed to be more dependent on glycolysis for their energy requirements than normal cells and, therefore, can be easily targeted by alteration in the energy-metabolic pathways, a hallmark of CR. Apart from",
    "Diet-derived polyphenols inhibit angiogenesis by modulating the interleukin-6/STAT3 pathway.\tSeveral epidemiological studies have indicated that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with a reduced risk of developing several types of cancers. This chemopreventive effect is related to the high content of these foods in phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, that interfere with several processes involved in cancer progression including tumor cell growth, survival and angiogenesis. In addition to the low intake of plant-based foods, increased body mass and physical inactivity have recently emerged as other important lifestyle factors influencing cancer risk, leading to the generation of low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions which are a key process involved in tumor progression"
