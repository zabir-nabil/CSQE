    "Diabetes is often referred to as a disease of fat toxicity due to the significant impact of excess fat on the development and progression of the condition. When the body accumulates excess fat, especially visceral fat around the abdomen, it disrupts the normal functioning of cells and tissues, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs when cells no longer respond effectively to insulin, a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels.\n\nAs the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, it requires more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. This increased demand on the pancreas to produce extra insulin eventually leads to the exhaustion of pancreatic cells, resulting in a decrease in insulin production. With reduced insulin levels and ongoing insulin resistance, blood sugar levels become elevated, contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nFurthermore, excess fat in the body releases inflammatory substances that further impair insulin signaling and promote chronic low-grade inflammation, exacerbating the metabolic dysfunction associated with diabetes. This inflammatory state not only affects glucose metabolism but also contributes to the development of other complications such as cardiovascular disease and kidney damage.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between fat toxicity and diabetes underscores the critical importance of maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle to prevent the onset of this metabolic disorder. By reducing excess fat through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and effective stress management, individuals can help mitigate the risk of developing diabetes and its associated complications.",
    "Diabetes has been increasingly recognized as a disease rooted in fat toxicity, particularly in relation to excess visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat, which surrounds vital organs in the abdomen, has been linked to an increased risk of insulin resistance and inflammation, both key factors in the development of type 2 diabetes. When visceral fat cells become overloaded with excess energy, they can release toxic byproducts that interfere with insulin signaling and disrupt glucose metabolism in the body.\n\nFurthermore, chronic low-grade inflammation associated with excessive fat accumulation can also contribute to insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic function, further exacerbating the progression of diabetes. As such, reducing visceral fat through lifestyle modifications such as healthy eating and regular physical activity can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nRecognizing the role of fat toxicity in diabetes underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy body composition and adopting behaviors that promote metabolic health. By addressing the root cause of the disease and focusing on reducing fat accumulation, individuals can take proactive steps to manage and prevent diabetes more effectively."

    "High Fat Intake Leads to Acute Postprandial Exposure to Circulating Endotoxin in Type 2 Diabetic Subjects\tOBJECTIVE To evaluate the changes in circulating endotoxin after a high\u2013saturated fat meal to determine whether these effects depend on metabolic disease state. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subjects (n = 54) were given a high-fat meal (75 g fat, 5 g carbohydrate, 6 g protein) after an overnight fast (nonobese control [NOC]: age 39.9 \u00b1 11.8 years [mean \u00b1 SD], BMI 24.9 \u00b1 3.2 kg/m2, n = 9; obese: age 43.8 \u00b1 9.5 years, BMI 33.3 \u00b1 2.5 kg/m2, n = 15; impaired",
    "Dietary Fat and Cholesterol and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Older Adults: the Health ABC Study\tBACKGROUND AND AIMS Although dietary fats and cholesterol have previously been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle aged populations, less is known among older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between dietary fats, cholesterol, and eggs and CVD risk among community-dwelling adults aged 70\u201379 in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. METHODS AND RESULTS Diet was assessed using an interviewer-administered 108-item food frequency questionnaire (n=1,941). CVD events were defined as a confirmed myocardial infarction, coronary death, or stroke. Relative rates of",
    "Laboratory, Epidemiological, and Human Intervention Studies Show That Tea (Camellia sinensis) May Be Useful in the Prevention of Obesity\tTea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) and tea polyphenols have been studied for the prevention of chronic diseases, including obesity. Obesity currently affects >20% of adults in the United States and is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Given this increasing public health concern, the use of dietary agents for the prevention of obesity would be of tremendous benefit. Whereas many laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of green or black tea for the prevention of obesity, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",
    "Hibiscus sabdariffa L. in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia: a comprehensive review of animal and human studies\tThe effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HS) in the treatment of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease is assessed in this review by taking a comprehensive approach to interpreting the randomized clinical trial (RCT) results in the context of the available ethnomedical, phytochemical, pharmacological, and safety and toxicity information. HS decoctions and infusions of calyxes, and on occasion leaves, are used in at least 10 countries worldwide in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with no reported adverse events or side effects. HS extracts have a low degree of toxicity with a LD50 ranging from 2,000 to",
    "Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes: tracing the reverse route from cure to cause.\tThe metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes can be reversed reproducibly by bariatric surgery. By quantifying the major pathophysiological abnormalities in insulin secretion and insulin action after surgery, the sequence of events leading to restoration of normal metabolism can be defined. Liver fat levels fall within days and normal hepatic insulin sensitivity is restored. Simultaneously, plasma glucose levels return towards normal. Insulin sensitivity of muscle remains abnormal, at least over the weeks and months after bariatric surgery. The effect of the surgery is explicable solely in terms of energy restriction. By combining this information with prospective observation of the changes immediately preceding the",
    "Diet, lifestyle, and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women.\tBACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined individual dietary and lifestyle factors in relation to type 2 diabetes, but the combined effects of these factors are largely unknown. METHODS: We followed 84,941 female nurses from 1980 to 1996; these women were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer at base line. Information about their diet and lifestyle was updated periodically. A low-risk group was defined according to a combination of five variables: a bodymass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of less than 25; a diet high in cereal fiber",
    "Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by changes in lifestyle among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.\tBACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Whether type 2 diabetes can be prevented by interventions that affect the lifestyles of subjects at high risk for the disease is not known. METHODS: We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group.",
    "Low-carbohydrate diet scores and risk of type 2 diabetes in men\tBackground: Fat and protein sources may influence whether low-carbohydrate diets are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Objective: The objective was to compare the associations of 3 low-carbohydrate diet scores with incident T2D. Design: A prospective cohort study was conducted in participants from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of T2D, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at baseline (n = 40,475) for up to 20 y. Cumulative averages of 3 low-carbohydrate diet scores (high total protein and fat, high animal protein and fat, and high vegetable protein and fat) were calculated",
    "Phytochemicals and their impact on adipose tissue inflammation and diabetes.\tType 2 diabetes mellitus is an inflammatory disease and the mechanisms that underlie this disease, although still incompletely understood, take place in the adipose tissue of obese subjects. Concurrently, the prevalence of obesity caused by Western diet's excessive energy intake and the lack of exercise escalates, and is believed to be causative for the chronic inflammatory state in adipose tissue. Overnutrition itself as an overload of energy may induce the adipocytes to secrete chemokines activating and attracting immune cells to adipose tissue. But also inflammation-mediating food ingredients like saturated fatty acids are believed to directly initiate the inflammatory cascade. In addition, hypoxia in adipose",
    "Diet and cell growth modulation by ammonia.\tFiber is not digested by endogenous enzymes but is fermented by microbes principally in the large intestine. With fermentable energy available, microbes synthesize protein by using ammonia released by their enzymes from urea and other nitrogenous substances in ingesta and intestinal secretions. Fibber fermentation also yields fatty acids that lower the concentration of free ammonia by lowering pH. Fiber increases bulk and water of intestinal contents, shortens transit time, and decreases the concentration of toxic substances in contact with the intestinal mucosa. These processes decrease duration and intensity of exposure of the intestinal mucosa to free ammonia, the form of nitrogen that is most toxic and most readily absorbed by cells."
