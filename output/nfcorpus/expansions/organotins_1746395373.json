    "Organotins are a class of chemical compounds that contain a tin atom bonded to one or more organic groups. These compounds can be found in various industrial and consumer products, including pesticides, stabilizers, and catalysts. One of the most common uses of organotins is as biocides in antifouling paints used on boat hulls to prevent the growth of marine organisms. However, organotins have raised environmental and health concerns due to their toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the food chain. Efforts have been made to regulate the use of organotins and find alternative compounds that are less harmful to the environment. Overall, the impact of organotins on human health and the environment continues to be an area of active research and regulation.",
    "Organotins refer to a group of chemical compounds that contain tin atoms bonded to organic groups. These compounds have been widely used in various industrial applications such as stabilizers in plastic manufacturing, slimicides in marine paints, and catalysts in organic reactions. However, concerns have been raised about the potential environmental and health risks associated with organotins due to their toxic properties and persistence in the environment. As a result, regulatory measures have been implemented to restrict or ban the use of certain organotins in consumer products. It is important for industries and regulatory agencies to continue monitoring and managing the use of organotins to minimize their harmful impacts on human health and the environment."

    "Environmental obesogens: organotins and endocrine disruption via nuclear receptor signaling.\tOver the last two decades, the incidence of obesity and associated metabolic syndrome diseases has risen dramatically, becoming a global health crisis. Increased caloric intake and decreased physical activity are believed to represent the root causes of this dramatic rise. However, recent findings highlight the possible involvement of environmental obesogens, xenobiotic chemicals that can disrupt the normal developmental and homeostatic controls over adipogenesis and energy balance. Environmental estrogens, i.e. chemicals with estrogenic potential, have been reported to perturb adipogenic mechanisms using in vitro model systems, but other classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals are now coming under scrutiny as well. Organotins represent one class",
    "Dietary intake of organotin compounds in Finland: a market-basket study.\tThe objective of this study was to estimate the intake of organic tin compounds from foodstuffs in a Finnish market basket. The study was conducted by collecting 13 market baskets from supermarkets and market places in the city of Kuopio, eastern Finland. Altogether 115 different food items were bought. In each basket, foodstuffs were mixed in proportion to their consumption and analysed by GC/MS for seven organic tin compounds (mono-, di-, and tributyltin, mono-, di-, and triphenyltin, and dioctyltin). Organotin compounds were detected in only four baskets, with the fish basket containing the largest number of"
