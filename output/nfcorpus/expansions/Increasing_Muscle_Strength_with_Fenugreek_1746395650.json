    "Fenugreek is a versatile herb that has been shown to potentially enhance muscle strength when used in conjunction with a regular exercise routine. Studies have suggested that fenugreek may help to increase levels of testosterone, a hormone essential for muscle growth and strength. By promoting testosterone production, fenugreek may support muscle repair and growth after workouts, ultimately leading to improved muscle strength over time.\n\nIncorporating fenugreek into your diet or supplement regimen, along with a well-rounded exercise program that includes strength training, could potentially enhance your muscle strength and overall fitness levels. As always, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or fitness professional before starting any new supplement or exercise routine to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your individual needs and goals.",
    "Fenugreek, a versatile herb known for its various health benefits, has been studied for its potential to help increase muscle strength. Research suggests that fenugreek may have an effect on muscle mass and strength due to its bioactive compounds, such as furostanolic saponins and protodioscin. These compounds are believed to promote the production of testosterone, a key hormone for muscle growth and strength.\n\nSeveral studies have shown promising results regarding the impact of fenugreek on muscle strength. One study conducted on resistance-trained men found that supplementation with fenugreek extract was associated with significant improvements in upper and lower body strength compared to a placebo group. Another study showed positive effects of fenugreek supplementation on muscle endurance and anaerobic performance in resistance-trained individuals.\n\nIncorporating fenugreek into your supplementation regimen, along with a balanced diet and regular exercise routine, may help support your efforts to increase muscle strength.

Fenugreek, maple syrup and the urine of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients all share a characteristic odour originating from a common component, sotolone.

    "Statin therapy, muscle function and falls risk in community-dwelling older adults.\tBACKGROUND: Statin therapy can cause myopathy, however it is unclear whether this exacerbates age-related muscle function declines. AIM: To describe differences between statin users and non-users in muscle mass, muscle function and falls risk in a group of community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: A prospective, population-based cohort study with a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. METHODS: Total 774 older adults [48% female; mean (standard deviation) age = 62 (7) years] were examined at baseline and follow-up. Differences in percentage appendicular lean mass",
    "Efficacy of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing the symptoms of muscle damage\tBackground Numerous antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory agents have been identified in tart cherries. Objective To test the efficacy of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing the symptoms of exercise induced muscle damage. Methods This was a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover design. Fourteen male college students drank 12\u2005fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo twice a day for eight consecutive days. A bout of eccentric elbow flexion contractions (2 \u00d7 20 maximum contractions) was performed on the fourth day of supplementation. Isometric elbow flexion strength, pain, muscle tenderness, and relaxed elbow angle were recorded before and for",
    "Influence of tart cherry juice on indices of recovery following marathon running.\tThis investigation determined the efficacy of a tart cherry juice in aiding recovery and reducing muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative stress. Twenty recreational Marathon runners assigned to either consumed cherry juice or placebo for 5 days before, the day of and for 48 h following a Marathon run. Markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, muscle soreness and isometric strength), inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and uric acid], total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress [thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and protein carbonyls] were examined before and",

    "Whole-Body Vibration and the Prevention and Treatment of Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness\tContext: Numerous recovery strategies have been used in an attempt to minimize the symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Whole-body vibration (WBV) has been suggested as a viable warm-up for athletes. However, scientific evidence to support the protective effects of WBV training (WBVT) on muscle damage is lacking. Objective: To investigate the acute effect of WBVT applied before eccentric exercise in the prevention of DOMS. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 32 healthy, untrained volunteers were randomly assigned to",
    "Fresh meat and further processing characteristics of ham muscles from finishing pigs fed ractopamine hydrochloride.\tRactopamine hydrochloride (RAC) has consistently led to an advantage in carcass cutting yields of finishing pigs and remains a common feed additive in US finishing pig diets. Less is known about the effect of RAC on further processing characteristics. Some researchers have reported advantages in ultimate pH of the LM in pigs fed RAC. If a greater ultimate pH was also observed in hams, the increased pH could affect further processing characteristics and lead to better protein interaction and improved textural properties. The objective of this experiment was to determine if RAC-fed pigs yielded hams with a greater ultimate pH, and",
    "Regulation of skeletal muscle mass in mice by a new TGF-beta superfamily member.\tThe transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily encompasses a large group of growth and differentiation factors playing important roles in regulating embryonic development and in maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult animals. Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction, we have identified a new murine TGF-beta family member, growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), which is expressed specifically in developing and adult skeletal muscle. During early stages of embryogenesis, GDF-8 expression is restricted to the myotome compartment of developing somites. At later stages and in adult animals, GDF-8 is expressed in many different muscles throughout the body.",
    "Free fatty acids and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute exposure to fatty acids causes insulin resistance in muscle, and excess dietary lipid and obesity are also strongly associated with muscle insulin resistance. Relevant mechanisms, however, are still not fully elucidated. Here we examine the latest evidence as to why lipids might accumulate in muscle and the possible mechanisms for lipid-induced insulin resistance. RECENT FINDINGS: Muscle lipid metabolites such as long chain fatty acid coenzyme As, diacylglycerol and ceramides may impair insulin signalling directly. Crosstalk between inflammatory signalling pathways and insulin signalling pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have also been put forward as major contributors to the development or maintenance",
    "Dexamethasone facilitates lipid accumulation in chicken skeletal muscle.\tThe effects of glucocorticoid on lipid metabolism of broiler chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) skeletal muscle were investigated. Male Arbor Acres chickens (35 days old) were subjected to dexamethasone treatment for 3 days. We found that dexamethasone retards body growth while facilitating lipid accumulation. In M. pectoralis major (PM), dexamethasone increased the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) mRNA and decreased the expression of liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (L-CPT1), adenosine-",
    "Effects of intravenous and dietary lipid challenge on intramyocellular lipid content and the relation with insulin sensitivity in humans.\tAn increased intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content, as quantified by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. At present, it is unclear which factors determine IMCL formation and how rapidly IMCL accumulation can be induced. We therefore studied the impact of hyperinsulinemia and elevated circulating nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels on IMCL formation and insulin sensitivity. We further evaluated the influence of a high-fat diet on IMCL storage. In the infusion protocol, 12 healthy male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-"
