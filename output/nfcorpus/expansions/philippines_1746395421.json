    "Coconut oil predicts a beneficial lipid profile in pre-menopausal women in the Philippines\tCoconut oil is a common edible oil in many countries, and there is mixed evidence for its effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. Here we examine the association between coconut oil consumption and lipid profiles in a cohort of 1,839 Filipino women (age 35\u201369 years) participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, a community based study in Metropolitan Cebu City. Coconut oil intake was measured as individual coconut oil intake calculated using two 24-hour dietary recalls (9.54 \u00b1 8.92 grams).

    "Molecular epidemiology of rabies virus in Vietnam (2006-2009).\tThis study was aimed at determining the molecular epidemiology of rabies virus (RABV) circulating in Vietnam. Intra vitam samples (saliva and cerebrospinal fluid) were collected from 31 patients who were believed to have rabies and were admitted to hospitals in northern provinces of Vietnam. Brain samples were collected from 176 sick or furious rabid dogs from all over the country. The human and canine samples were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The findings showed that 23 patients tested positive for RABV. Interestingly, 5 rabies patients did not have any history of dog or cat bites, but they had an",
    "The effect of Momordica charantia capsule preparation on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus needs further studies.\tBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Momordica charantia, locally known as Ampalaya, is being widely used and advertised for its hypoglycemic effects. However, to date, no large clinical trial has been published on the efficacy of any type of preparation. The main objective of this study is to determine if addition of M. charantia capsules to standard therapy can decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c) levels in diabetic patients with poor sugar control. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between April and September 2004 at the outpatient clinics"
