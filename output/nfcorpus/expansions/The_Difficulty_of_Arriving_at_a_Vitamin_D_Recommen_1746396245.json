    "Arriving at a definitive recommendation for vitamin D intake can be a challenging task due to several factors. Firstly, individuals have varying levels of sun exposure, which is a primary source of vitamin D. Factors such as skin tone, geographical location, time spent outdoors, and the use of sunscreen all affect how much vitamin D a person can naturally produce. \n\nFurthermore, the dietary sources of vitamin D are limited, with fatty fish, cod liver oil, fortified dairy products, and supplements being the most common sources. However, individual dietary habits can greatly influence vitamin D intake from these sources.\n\nAnother complicating factor is the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D through sunlight exposure. The process is not linear, and factors such as cloud cover, time of day, and season can impact the efficiency of vitamin D production in the body.\n\nMoreover, the optimal levels of vitamin D for health are still debated within the scientific and medical communities. While some experts believe that higher levels of vitamin D are beneficial for various health outcomes, others argue that the current recommended levels are sufficient.\n\nOverall, the complex interplay between sun exposure, dietary intake, individual characteristics, and the ongoing research in the field make it challenging to arrive at a universal recommendation for vitamin D intake. Healthcare providers must consider multiple factors when assessing an individual's vitamin D needs and make personalized recommendations based on their unique circumstances.",
    "The task of determining a recommended daily intake of vitamin D presents a significant challenge due to a variety of factors. One primary difficulty stems from the multiple sources through which the body can obtain this essential nutrient. Vitamin D can be synthesized by the skin upon exposure to sunlight, acquired through certain foods, and also taken in supplement form. This complexity in sourcing makes it challenging to pinpoint an exact recommended intake that would suit all individuals, as factors such as skin pigmentation, geographical location, dietary habits, and lifestyle choices all impact vitamin D levels.\n\nFurthermore, the optimal amount of vitamin D needed for various functions in the body, such as supporting bone health, immune function, and overall well-being, is still a topic of ongoing research and debate among experts. Different organizations and health authorities often provide varying recommendations for daily intake, further adding to the confusion for consumers and healthcare professionals alike.\n\nAdditionally, individual differences in metabolism, absorption rates, and the presence of underlying health conditions can influence the body's requirements for vitamin D. This variability in response to vitamin D intake makes it challenging to establish a one-size-fits-all recommendation that would apply universally.\n\nIn conclusion, the difficulty in arriving at a concrete vitamin D recommendation underscores the need for continued research, personalized assessment, and consideration of various factors that affect an individual's vitamin D status. As our understanding of this crucial nutrient evolves, so too should our approach to determining the optimal intake levels to support overall health and well-being."

    "Towards prevention of vitamin D deficiency and beyond: knowledge gaps and research needs in vitamin D nutrition and public health.\tThe North American Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently published their report on dietary reference intakes (DRI) for Ca and vitamin D. The DRI committee's deliberations underpinning this most comprehensive report on vitamin D nutrition to date benefited hugely from a much expanded knowledge base in vitamin D over the last decade or more. However, since their release, the vitamin D DRI have been the subject of intense controversy, which is largely due to the persistence of fundamental knowledge gaps in vitamin D. These can be identified at the levels of exposure, metabolism, storage,",
    "Vitamin D: extraskeletal health.\tVitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a",

    "Low Vitamin D Status: Definition, Prevalence, Consequences and Correction\tVitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3. An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Though controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be ~30-32 ng/ml or above. Using this definition, it has been is estimated that approximately three quarters of all adults in the United States are low. Classically,",

    "An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?\tThe multiple nuclear meltdowns at the Fukushima plants beginning on March 11, 2011, are releasing large amounts of airborne radioactivity that has spread throughout Japan and to other nations; thus, studies of contamination and health hazards are merited. In the United States, Fukushima fallout arrived just six days after the earthquake, tsunami, and meltdowns. Some samples of radioactivity in precipitation, air, water, and milk, taken by the U.S. government, showed levels hundreds of times above normal; however, the small number of samples prohibits any credible analysis of temporal trends",
