    "Airport scanners are a vital tool in ensuring passenger safety and security. These scanners use advanced technology to detect any potential threats or prohibited items that may be concealed on a person's body or in their belongings. By providing a non-intrusive way to screen passengers, airport scanners help to maintain the safety of all travelers and prevent potentially dangerous situations from arising. While some people may have concerns about privacy or radiation exposure, airport scanners are designed to protect passenger privacy and use minimal levels of radiation that are deemed safe for all individuals. Ultimately, airport scanners play a crucial role in the overall security measures implemented to keep airports and passengers safe during their travels.",
    "Airport scanners play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and security of passengers and airlines across the globe. These advanced scanning machines use various technologies such as X-rays, millimeter-wave imaging, or radio waves to detect any prohibited items or threats that individuals may be attempting to bring onto an aircraft. By swiftly scanning both passengers and their belongings, airport scanners help to identify potential risks and prevent dangerous situations from arising during travel. While some people may feel concerned about their privacy when going through these scanners, it is important to remember that the primary goal is to safeguard the well-being of everyone on board. Overall, airport scanners are a vital component of modern aviation security protocols, providing an added layer of protection for passengers and crew alike."

    "An investigation of the structural aspects of the tomato fruit by means of quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.\tIn this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to study the structural aspects of the tomato fruit. The main study was performed on tomatoes (cv. Tradiro) using a 0.2-T electromagnet scanner. Spin-echo images were acquired to visualize the tomato macrostructure. The air bubble content in tissues was evaluated by exploiting susceptibility effects using multiple gradient echo images. The microstructure was further studied by measuring spin-spin (T(2)) and spin-lattice (T(1)) relaxation time distributions. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry, macro vision imaging and chemical",
    "\"USA-Fat\": prevalence is related to ambient outdoor temperature-evaluation with 18F-FDG PET/CT.\tIncreased (18)F-FDG activity in fatty tissue has previously been reported with PET/CT. We previously named this activity uptake in supraclavicular area fat (\"USA-Fat\"). We and others have speculated that this uptake exists in metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT). Such tissue might be expected to have varying metabolic activity depending on the ambient temperature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of USA-Fat and its relationship to the outdoor temperature. METHODS: Between July 2001 and June 2002, 1,017 consecutive",
    "Uptake in supraclavicular area fat (\"USA-Fat\"): description on 18F-FDG PET/CT.\tThe supraclavicular region is a common site for lymph node metastases. A commonly reported type of nonmalignant (18)F-FDG uptake on PET imaging in the supraclavicular region is \"muscle uptake\" purportedly due to muscle contraction in tense patients during the (18)F-FDG uptake phase. PET/CT offers the unique opportunity to correlate PET findings with CT anatomy in the supraclavicular region. METHODS: Images from the first 359 consecutive clinical whole-body studies (in 347 patients) using (18)F-FDG and a PET/CT scanner (with CT attenuation correction and"
