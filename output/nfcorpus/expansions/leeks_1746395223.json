    "Leeks are a type of vegetable that belong to the allium family, which also includes onions and garlic. They have a mild onion-like flavor and are known for their long, slender white stalks with dark green leaves at the top. Leeks are versatile in cooking and can be used in a variety of dishes such as soups, stews, salads, and stir-fries. To prepare leeks, it is important to clean them thoroughly as they can trap dirt and mud between their layers. Once cleaned, leeks can be sliced and cooked until tender to add a subtle yet delicious flavor to your meals. Rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, leeks are not only flavorful but also nutritious, making them a great addition to a healthy diet.",

    "Intakes of Garlic and Dried Fruits Are Associated with Lower Risk of Spontaneous Preterm Delivery\tSeveral studies have found associations between microbial infections during pregnancy and preterm delivery (PTD). We investigated the influence of food with antimicrobial and prebiotic components on the risk of spontaneous PTD. A literature search identified microbes associated with spontaneous PTD. Subsequently, 2 main food types (alliums and dried fruits) were identified to contain antimicrobial components that affect the microbes associated with spontaneous PTD; they also contained dietary fibers recognized as prebiotics. We investigated intake in 18,888 women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa), of whom 950 (5%) underwent spontaneous PTD (<37 gestational",
    "Translocation of Crohn's disease Escherichia coli across M-cells: contrasting effects of soluble plant fibres and emulsifiers\tBackground Crohn's disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer's patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells. Methods To assess effects of soluble plant fibres and food emulsifiers on translocation of mucosa-associated E coli isolates from Crohn's disease patients and from non-Crohn's controls, we used M-cell"
