    "Rickets is a condition that affects bone development in children, causing soft, weak bones. It is primarily caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, which is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the body. Without enough vitamin D, bones can become weak and deformities may develop. Rickets can be prevented and treated with proper supplementation of vitamin D, exposure to sunlight, and a diet rich in calcium and phosphorus. Children at higher risk for rickets include those with dark skin, those who are exclusively breastfed without vitamin D supplementation, and those who live in areas with limited sunlight. Early detection and intervention are key in managing rickets and preventing potential complications in bone health.",
    "Rickets is a condition that primarily affects children and is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus. This deficiency can lead to weakened or soft bones, as vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the body. Without sufficient levels of these nutrients, bone development can be impaired, resulting in symptoms such as bowed legs, delayed growth, and muscle weakness. Rickets can be prevented and treated by ensuring proper nutrition, adequate sun exposure for vitamin D synthesis, and, if necessary, supplementation under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Regular monitoring and early intervention are essential in managing rickets to promote optimal bone health and overall well-being in affected individuals."

    "Low Vitamin D Status: Definition, Prevalence, Consequences and Correction\tVitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3. An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Though controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be ~30-32 ng/ml or above. Using this definition, it has been is estimated that approximately three quarters of all adults in the United States are low. Classically,"
