    "Artificial food colors have been a topic of interest and concern in relation to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Some studies suggest that certain artificial food colors may exacerbate symptoms of ADHD in some individuals, while others have not found a significant link. The debate continues within the scientific community regarding the impact of artificial food colors on ADHD.\n\nWhile some parents and healthcare professionals believe that avoiding artificial food colors can help manage ADHD symptoms, more research is needed to fully understand the potential effects. It is important for individuals with ADHD or their caregivers to work closely with healthcare providers to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that may include dietary modifications.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between artificial food colors and ADHD is complex and varies from person to person. It is important to approach this topic with an open mind, relying on evidence-based information and individualized care to effectively address ADHD symptoms.",
    "There has been ongoing debate and research regarding the possible link between artificial food colors and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Some studies suggest that certain artificial colors, commonly found in processed foods and beverages, may contribute to hyperactivity and impulsivity in children with ADHD. However, the research findings are mixed and inconclusive.\n\nWhile some parents report noticing behavioral changes in their children after consuming foods with artificial colors, other studies have failed to establish a direct causal relationship between artificial food colors and ADHD symptoms. It is essential to consider individual differences, genetic factors, and overall diet when examining the impact of artificial colors on ADHD.\n\nAs researchers continue to investigate this topic, it is advisable for parents and caregivers of children with ADHD to be mindful of their food choices and consider opting for natural, unprocessed foods whenever possible. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist can also provide personalized recommendations for managing ADHD symptoms through diet and lifestyle modifications."

    "Artificial Food Colors and ADHD, Artificial food colors (AFCs) have not been established as the main cause of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup shows significant symptom improvement when consuming an AFC-free diet and reacts with ADHD-type symptoms on challenge with AFCs. Of children with suspected sensitivities, 65% to 89% reacted when challenged with at least 100 mg of AFC. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold, who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children.",

    "Dietary sensitivities and ADHD symptoms: thirty-five years of research.\tArtificial food colors (AFCs) have not been established as the main cause of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup shows significant symptom improvement when consuming an AFC-free diet and reacts with ADHD-type symptoms on challenge with AFCs. Of children with suspected sensitivities, 65% to 89% reacted when challenged with at least 100 mg of AFC. Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well",
    "Artificial food dyes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\tAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common behavioral disorders in children. Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, and inattention. While the biological pathways leading to ADHD are not clearly delineated, a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disorder are recognized. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. As a result",
    "The effects of physical activity on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms: the evidence.\tEvidence supports the beneficial effects of physical activity (PA) on cognitive performance and suggests that effects might be particularly large for children. However, limited research has explored PA as a means of managing behavioral symptoms and improving cognitive performance of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The etiology of ADHD and the putative mechanisms for the effects of PA on cognitive performance suggest that PA might be especially important for this population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the literature regarding the potential of PA for ADHD symptom management, particularly in regard to behavioral and cognitive symptoms.",
    "ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND URINARY METABOLITES OF ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDES IN U.S. CHILDREN 8\u201315 YEARS\tContext Exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides is common, and although these compounds have known neurotoxic properties, few studies examined risks for children in the general population. Objective To examine the association between the concentrations of urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OPs and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children age 8 to 15 years. Participants and Methods Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2000\u20132004) were available for 1,139 children representative of the general U.S. population. A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, based",
    "Phthalates exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in school-age children.\tBACKGROUND: Very few studies have examined the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and phthalate exposure in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of phthalates on symptoms of ADHD in school-age children. METHODS: A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on measures of ADHD symptoms and neuropsychological dysfunction with regard to attention and impulsivity were obtained from 261 Korean children, age 8-11 years. RESULTS: Mono-2-ethylheyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexylphthalate (MEOP) for metabolites of Di-2",
    "Sugar substitutes: Health controversy over perceived benefits\tSugar is an inseparable part of the food we consume. But too much sugar is not ideal for our teeth and waistline. There have been some controversial suggestions that excessive sugar may play an important role in certain degenerative diseases. So artificial sweeteners or artificially sweetened products continue to attract consumers. A sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) is a food additive that duplicates the effect of sugar in taste, but usually has less food energy. Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. Some kind of health related side effects including carcinogenicity are",
    "Carcinogenicity and regulation of caramel colorings.\t2- and 4-methylimidazoles are present as contaminants in caramel colorings manufactured with ammonia catalysts. Both contaminants have been shown to induce cancer in animals and may be present in caramel colorings in amounts that exceed federal guidelines. California requires warning notices on products that could lead to consumption of more than 30 micrograms per day. The US Food and Drug Administration should bar the use of excessively contaminated caramel coloring in food.",
    "Synthetic Food Colors and Neurobehavioral Hazards: The View from Environmental Health Research\tBackground: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year",
    "The color red reduces snack food and soft drink intake.\tBased on evidence that the color red elicits avoidance motivation across contexts (Mehta & Zhu, 2009), two studies investigated the effect of the color red on snack food and soft drink consumption. In line with our hypothesis, participants drank less from a red labeled cup than from a blue labeled cup (Study 1), and ate less snack food from a red plate than from a blue or white plate (Study 2). The results suggest that red functions as a subtle stop signal that works outside of focused awareness and thereby reduces incidental food and drink intake. Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Iris color and macular pigment optical density.\tThe present study was designed to assess the relationship between iris color and macular pigment optical density. Both melanin and carotenoids (responsible for iris color and macular pigment composition, respectively) appear to protect the retina through similar mechanisms and higher concentrations may reduce the incidence of retinal degenerations. To evaluate this relationship, 95 subjects were examined and the following variables were measured: iris color; macular pigment optical density (MP); plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and beta-carotene; dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin and beta-carotene; and total fat intake. Iris color was determined by self assessment and classified as blue or"
