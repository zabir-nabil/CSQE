    "Detoxing from fish before pregnancy is an important consideration due to the potential risks associated with mercury exposure on the developing fetus. The timeline for detoxing from fish can vary depending on several factors such as the type and amount of fish consumed, individual metabolism, and overall health status.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to stop consuming fish high in mercury at least 3-6 months before attempting to conceive to allow the body to eliminate any accumulated toxins. This detox period can help reduce the levels of mercury in the body and decrease the potential risks of exposure to the unborn child.\n\nConsulting with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist can provide personalized recommendations on the safest and most effective ways to detox from fish before pregnancy. Additionally, focusing on a healthy and balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-mercury fish can support the body's natural detoxification process and promote overall well-being for both the mother and the baby.",
    "Detoxing from fish before pregnancy can vary depending on the type of fish consumed and the level of toxins present in the body. It is generally recommended to avoid consuming fish known to be high in mercury, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish, for at least several months before trying to conceive to allow the body to eliminate any accumulated toxins. For other types of fish, a detox period of around 3-6 months is often suggested to ensure that the body is free of harmful substances that could potentially impact the health of the developing fetus. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations based on individual health factors and dietary habits."

    "From milk to malignancy: the role of mammary stem cells in development, pregnancy and breast cancer\tAdult stem cells of the mammary gland (MaSCs) are a highly dynamic population of cells that are responsible for the generation of the gland during puberty and its expansion during pregnancy. In recent years significant advances have been made in understanding how these cells are regulated during these developmentally important processes both in humans and in mice. Understanding how MaSCs are regulated is becoming a particularly important area of research, given that they may be particularly susceptible targets for transformation in breast cancer. Here, we summarize the identification of MaSCs, how they are regulated and the evidence for their serving as",
    "Hair mercury levels of women of reproductive age in Ontario, Canada: implications to fetal safety and fish consumption.\tOBJECTIVE: To study hair mercury concentrations among women of reproductive age in relation to fish intake in Ontario, Canada. STUDY DESIGN: Three groups were studied: 22 women who had called the Motherisk Program for information on the reproductive safety of consuming fish during pregnancy, a group of Japanese residing in Toronto (n=23) consuming much larger amounts of fish, and a group of Canadian women of reproductive age (n=20) not seeking advice, were studied. Mercury concentrations in hair samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Seafood consumption habits were recorded for",
    "Fish consumption during child bearing age: a quantitative risk-benefit analysis on neurodevelopment.\tThe fish ingredient N3-docosahexaenoic acid 22:6 n-3 (DHA) stimulates brain development. On the other hand methylmercury (MeHg) in fish disturbs the developing central nervous system. In this Context the IQ score in children is considered as an aggregate measure of in utero brain development. To determine the effect of DHA exposure on prenatal neurodevelopment the maternal DHA intake during pregnancy was compared with its epidemiologically observed effect on the IQ score of children. For MeHg the maternal intake was converted into its accumulation in the maternal body. The maternal body burden then was compared with its epidemiologically observed relationship with",
    "Fish consumption, methylmercury and child neurodevelopment\tPurpose of review To summarize recent evidence regarding associations of early life exposure to mercury from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy, thimerosal in vaccines and dental amalgam with child neurodevelopment. Recent findings Recent publications have built upon previous evidence demonstrating mild detrimental neurocognitive effects from prenatal methylmercury exposure from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy. New studies examining the effects of prenatal fish consumption as well as methylmercury suggest there are benefits from prenatal fish consumption, but also that consumption of fish high in mercury should be avoided. Future studies incorporating information on both the methylmercury and the docosahexaenoic acid contained within fish will help to refine recommendations to optimize outcomes for mothers and children.",
    "Differential effects of reproductive factors on the risk of pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer. Results from a large cohort of French women\tThe aim of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the role of hormonal factors in breast cancer risk and to determine whether the effect of reproductive events differs according to age at diagnosis. It analysed the effect of age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, number of full-term pregnancies and number of spontaneous abortions both on the overall risk of breast cancer and on its pre- or postmenopausal onset, using the data on 1718 breast cancer cases, obtained from a large sample of around 100\u200a000 French women participating in",
    "Associations of maternal long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, methyl mercury, and infant development in the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study\tFish consumption during gestation can provide the fetus with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and other nutrients essential for growth and development of the brain. However, fish consumption also exposes the fetus to the neurotoxicant, methyl mercury (MeHg). We studied the association between these fetal exposures and early child development in the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study (SCDNS). Specifically, we examined a priori models of \u03a9-3 and \u03a9-6 LCPUFA measures in maternal serum to test the hypothesis that these LCPUFA families before or after adjusting for prenatal MeHg exposure would reveal associations",

    "Heterocyclic amines: Mutagens/carcinogens produced during cooking of meat and fish.\tResearch leading to the discovery of a series of mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs) was inspired by the idea that smoke produced during cooking of food, especially meat or fish, might be carcinogenic. More than ten kinds of HCAs, actually produced by cooking or heating of meat or fish, have now been isolated and their structures determined, most being previously unregistered compounds. They are highly mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of S9 mix and are also mutagenic in vitro and in vivo toward mammalian cells. HCAs have now been chemically synthesized in quantity and subjected to long-term animal",
