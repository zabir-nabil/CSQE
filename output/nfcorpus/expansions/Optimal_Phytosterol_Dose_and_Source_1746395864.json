    "Determining the optimal phytosterol dose and source is crucial for maximizing the health benefits of these plant-derived compounds. Phytosterols have been shown to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease, making them a valuable addition to a healthy diet. Studies have suggested that a daily intake of 2 grams of phytosterols can lead to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol levels. \n\nWhen it comes to sources of phytosterols, plant-based foods such as nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are good options. Additionally, phytosterol-fortified products like margarine and yogurt are available for those looking to increase their phytosterol intake. It is important to choose sources that are easy to incorporate into your daily diet and provide a sufficient amount of phytosterols to reap their benefits.\n\nUltimately, the optimal phytosterol dose and source may vary depending on individual factors such as age, health status, and dietary preferences. Consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist can help determine the best approach for integrating phytosterols into your diet to support overall health and well-being.",

    "Optimal Phytosterol Dose and Source The Effects of Phytosterols Present in Natural Food Matrices on Cholesterol Metabolism and LDL-Cholesterol: A Controlled Feeding Trial Extrinsic phytosterols supplemented to the diet reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma LDL-cholesterol. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that intrinsic phytosterols present in unmodified foods alter whole-body cholesterol metabolism. Phytosterol composition of nuts and seeds commonly consumed in the United States. Sesame seed and wheat germ had the highest total phytosterol content (400-413 mg/100 g) and Brazil nuts the lowest (95 mg/100 g). Of the products typically consumed as snack foods, pistachio and sunflower kernel were the richest in phytosterols (270-289 mg/100 g).",

    "Phytosterol composition of nuts and seeds commonly consumed in the United States.\tPhytosterols were quantified in nuts and seeds commonly consumed in the United States. Total lipid extracts were subjected to acid hydrolysis and then alkaline saponfication, and free sterols were analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives by capillary GC-FID and GC-MS. Delta5-Avenasterol was quantified after alkaline saponification plus direct analysis of the glucoside. Sesame seed and wheat germ had the highest total phytosterol content (400-413 mg/100 g) and Brazil nuts the lowest (95 mg/100 g).

    "Evaluation of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of anisakis simplex parasite as a food-borne allergen source in seafo...\tAnisakis simplex has been recognized as an important cause of disease in humans and as a food-borne allergen source. Actually, this food-borne parasite was recently identified as an emerging food safety risk. An A. simplex -specific primer-probe system based on a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection assay has been successfully optimized and validated with seafood samples. In addition, a DNA extraction procedure has been optimized to detect the presence of the nematode in food samples. The assay is a very reliable",

    "Natural products as sources of new drugs over the last 25 years.\tThis review is an updated and expanded version of two prior reviews that were published in this journal in 1997 and 2003. In the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 251/2 years from 01/1981 to 06/2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06/2006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a \"natural product mimic\" or \"NM\" to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final",
    "Low Vitamin D Status: Definition, Prevalence, Consequences and Correction\tVitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3. An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Though controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be ~30-32 ng/ml or above. Using this definition, it has been is estimated that approximately three quarters of all adults in the United States are low. Classically,",
    "Nowhere to hide: Chemical toxicants and the unborn child.\tContemporary reproductive aged women and their offspring are facing an unprecedented onslaught of toxicant exposures from myriad sources in their day-to-day life. Public health recommendations regarding optimal diet and nutrition in pregnancy must incorporate several considerations including safety of available foodstuffs, cultural practices and lifestyle issues. Gestational consumption of contaminated seafood remains a potential source of toxicant exposure, including mercury, for the developing child. Health care professionals responsible for the care of women and their developing children need to become apprised of: a) risks associated with toxicant bioaccumulation in pregnancy; b) ongoing information emerging in the important field of reproductive toxicology;",
    "Studies of fish consumption as source of methylmercury should consider fish-meal-fed farmed fish and other animal foods.\tThe co-occurrence of fish MeHg and omega-3 fatty acids in wild species can indeed be optimized by choosing certain species. Farmed finfish and shellfish that are fed fish-meal, however, can bioconcentrate both MeHg (in muscle) and organohalogen pollutants passed on in the fat components [Dorea, J.G., 2006. Fish meal in animal feed and human exposure to persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances. J.

METHODS: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The rates of any adverse events (AEs), most commonly reported AEs, withdrawals because of adverse events, and serious adverse events were ascertained and compared between sildenafil and placebo groups. The results of men with ED were stratified by clinical condition(s)",
    "Traditionally living populations in East Africa have a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 115\u00a0nmol/l.\tCutaneous synthesis of vitamin D by exposure to UVB is the principal source of vitamin D in the human body. Our current clothing habits and reduced time spent outdoors put us at risk of many insufficiency-related diseases that are associated with calcaemic and non-calcaemic functions of vitamin D. Populations with traditional lifestyles having lifelong, year-round exposure to tropical sunlight might provide us with information on optimal vitamin D status from an evolutionary perspective. We measured the sum of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\u2082 and D\u2083 (25(OH)D) concentrations of thirty-five pastoral Maasai (34"
