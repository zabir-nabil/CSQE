    "Blood clots are clumps of blood that have turned from a liquid state to a gel-like or semisolid state. They play a crucial role in stopping bleeding when a blood vessel is injured. However, when blood clots form inappropriately within blood vessels, they can lead to serious health issues such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or stroke. It is important to be aware of the risk factors for developing blood clots, which include prolonged immobility, certain medical conditions, and genetic factors. Prevention strategies such as staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking can help reduce the risk of blood clots. If you suspect you have a blood clot or are at risk, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly to receive appropriate treatment and prevent complications.",
    "Blood clots are a natural defense mechanism that helps the body to stop bleeding when there is an injury. They form when blood cells and platelets stick together to create a seal over a wound, preventing excessive blood loss. However, blood clots can also be harmful when they form inside blood vessels without an injury, leading to potentially dangerous blockages. These blockages can cause serious health problems, such as heart attacks or strokes. It's important to be aware of the risk factors for blood clots, such as smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle, and to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms like swelling or pain in your legs, chest pain, or sudden difficulty breathing. Preventive measures, such as staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking, can help reduce the risk of blood clots and protect your overall health."

    "blood clots The blood platelets are of significant importance in medicine. These cells are involved in many physiological processes, particularly haemostasis through their ability to aggregate and form clots in response to activation. Thrombosis is the primary event that precipitates stroke and acute coronary syndromes. The Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) was investigated for its uricosuric effect. A cup of tea made from 1.5 g of dry Roselle calyces was provided to subjects twice daily for 15 days. A clotted blood and two consecutive 24-h urine samples were collected from each subject.",

    "Platelet dysfunction in vascular pathologies and how can it be treated.\tCardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries, and although many processes play a role in the development of vascular disease, thrombosis is the primary event that precipitates stroke and acute coronary syndromes. The blood platelets are of significant importance in medicine. These cells are involved in many physiological processes, particularly haemostasis through their ability to aggregate and form clots in response to activation. In addition, these dynamic cells display activities that extend beyond thrombosis, including an important role in initiating and sustaining vascular inflammation. The expansion of knowledge from basic and clinical research has highlighted the critical position",
    "Antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic activity in vitro of extracts from selected fruits and vegetables.\tA diet rich in fruits and vegetables is known to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the information regarding the antithrombotic activity (antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic) of fruits and vegetables is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the antithrombotic activity of extracts from fruits and vegetables widely consumed in central Chile. The study included samples of 19 fruits and 26 vegetables, representative of the local diet. The extracts prepared from each sample included an aqueous (juice or pressed solubles) and/or methanol-soluble fraction. The extracts were evaluated for antiplatelet, anticoagulant,",
    "Primum Non Nocere: An Evolutionary Analysis of Whether Antidepressants Do More Harm than Good\tAntidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin \u2013 an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals, and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health",
    "Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in edible wild plants.\tHuman beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and was high in antioxidants. Edible wild plants provide alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and higher amounts of vitamin E and vitamin C than cultivated plants. In addition to the antioxidant vitamins, edible wild plants are rich in phenols and other compounds that increase their antioxidant capacity. It is therefore important to systematically analyze the total antioxidant capacity of wild plants and promote their commercialization in both developed and developing countries. The diets of Western countries have contained increasingly larger amounts of linoleic acid (LA), which",
    "Uricosuric effect of Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) in normal and renal-stone former subjects.\tAIM OF THE STUDY: The Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) was investigated for its uricosuric effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A human model with nine subjects with no history of renal stones (non-renal stone, NS) and nine with a history of renal stones (RS) was used in this study. A cup of tea made from 1.5 g of dry Roselle calyces was provided to subjects twice daily (morning and evening) for 15 days.

    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for newborn respiratory failure: forty-five cases.\tAlmost all types of newborn respiratory failure are reversible. However, supportive treatment (oxygen and positive airway pressure) can damage the lung, and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infants. Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to \"rest.\" We have used ECMO in 45 moribund newborn infants; 25 survived. Neonatologists referred patients who were unresponsive to maximal therapy. The right atrium and aortic arch were cannulated via the jugular vein and carotid artery. Heparin was infused continuously to main activated clotting time at 200 to 300 seconds.",

Two groups of dairy cows were selected to obtain low-SCC (<200,000 cells/mL) and high-SCC (>700,000 cells/mL) milks, which were used to manufacture 2 vats of cheese. The pasteurized milk was evaluated according to the pH, total solids, fat, total protein, lactose, standard plate count,",
    "The effects of blood pressure reduction and of different blood pressure-lowering regimens on major cardiovascular events according to baseline bloo...\tBACKGROUND: The benefits of reducing blood pressure are well established, but there remains uncertainty about whether the magnitude of the effect varies with the initial blood pressure level. The objective was to compare the risk reductions achieved by different blood pressure-lowering regimens among individuals with different baseline blood pressures. METHODS: Thirty-two randomized controlled trials were included and seven comparisons between different types of treatments were made. For each comparison, the primary prespecified analysis included calculation of summary estimates of effect using random-effects meta-analysis for major cardiovascular events in four",
