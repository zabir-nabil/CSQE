    "Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This condition occurs when a person ingests eggs of the tapeworm, which then hatch and travel to the brain or spinal cord, causing cyst formation. Symptoms of neurocysticercosis can vary depending on the location and number of cysts present, but may include headaches, seizures, confusion, and neurological deficits. Diagnosis is typically made through imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, and treatment may involve medications to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the cysts. Preventing neurocysticercosis involves proper sanitation, avoiding undercooked pork, and treating individuals with the tapeworm infection to prevent transmission. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you may have neurocysticercosis, as prompt treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.",
    "Neurocysticercosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. This condition occurs when these larvae enter the brain, spinal cord, or meninges and form cysts. Neurocysticercosis can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, including seizures, headaches, cognitive impairment, and in severe cases, it can cause life-threatening complications. Imaging studies such as MRI and CT scans are typically used to diagnose the condition, and treatment often involves a combination of anti-parasitic medication and anti-inflammatory drugs. It is important to seek medical attention promptly if neurocysticercosis is suspected, as early detection and treatment can help prevent serious complications and improve outcomes."

    "Calcified neurocysticercosis among patients with primary headache.\tBACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports and a single case-control epidemiological survey have suggested an association between the helminthic disease neurocysticercosis and primary headache. The present study was undertaken to determine whether neurocysticercosis is more common among patients with primary headaches than in other neurological disorders. METHODS: We determined the prevalence of neurocysticercosis in a cohort of patients with primary headache who were seen at our institution over a 20-year period. We used as controls all people from the same cohort with four major different categories of neurological disorders, including cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disorders of the CNS, head trauma, and primary brain tumors. We evaluated differences in the",

METHODS: Diagnosis of neurocysticercosis was established by CT, MRI, and CSF analysis. Psychiatric diagnoses were made by using the present state examination and the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia-lifetime version; cognitive state was assessed by mini mental state examination and Strub and Black's mental status examination. RESULTS: Signs of psychiatric disease and cognitive decline were found in 65.8 and 87.5% of the cases respectively. Depression was the most frequent psychiatric diagnosis (52.6%) and",
    "Aneurysm and Neurocysticercosis: Casual or Causal Relationship? Case Report and Review of the Literature\tFour cases of suggestive inflammatory aneurysms in patients with neurocysticercosis have been described. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm and had a casual relationship with neurocysticercosis. At surgery, a viable cysticercus without signs of inflammation or thickened leptomeninges was found in the distal position of the aneurysm. Postoperatively, the patient received albendazole and dextrochlorpheniramine. In the subsequent three years, the patient was asymptomatic and took drugs to prevent convulsion and arterial hypertension. The relationship between NCC and the presence of cerebral aneurysm is discussed",
    "The Impact of Neurocysticercosis in California: A Review of Hospitalized Cases\tTo assess the burden of neurocysticercosis (NCC) in California we examined statewide hospital discharge data for 2009. There were 304 cases hospitalized with NCC identified (incidence\u200a=\u200a0.8 per 100,000). Cases were mostly Latino (84.9%), slightly more likely to be male than female (men 57.6%, women 42.4%) with an average age of 43.5 years. A majority of cases were hospitalized in Southern California (72.1%) and many were hospitalized in Los Angeles County (44.7%). Men were more likely than women to have severe disease including hydrocephalus (29.7% vs. 18.6",
    "Cognitive impairment and dementia in neurocysticercosis: a cross-sectional controlled study.\tOBJECTIVES: Neurocysticercosis (NCYST) is the most frequent CNS parasitic disease worldwide, affecting more than 50 million people. However, some of its clinical findings, such as cognitive impairment and dementia, remain poorly characterized, with no controlled studies conducted so far. We investigated the frequency and the clinical profile of cognitive impairment and dementia in a sample of patients with NCYST in comparison with cognitively healthy controls (HC) and patients with cryptogenic epilepsy (CE). METHODS: Forty treatment-naive patients with NCYST, aged 39.25 +/- 10.50 years and fulfilling absolute criteria for definitive active NCYST on MRI",
    "Neurocysticercosis in pregnancy: not just another headache.\tInfection with pork tapeworm, or Taenia solium, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. The most important and potentially devastating form of the infestation, neurocysticercosis, occurs when the parasite invades the central nervous system. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases in the United States due to immigration from endemic areas. This case study of a pregnant woman in the 35th week of gestation exemplifies the serious consequences of this infection in pregnancy, and discusses an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, treatment and eradication of this preventable disease. \u00a9 2012 AWHONN.",
    "Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of neurocysticercosis.\tNeurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most frequent parasitic disease of the human brain. Modern imaging studies, CT and MRI, have defined the diagnosis and characterization of the disease. Through these studies the therapeutic approach for each case may be individualized with the aid of antihelmintics, steroids, symptomatic medicines, or surgery. The use of one or various therapeutic measures largely depends on the peculiar combination of number, location, and biological stage of lesions as well as the degree of inflammatory response to the parasites. Although there is not a typical clinical picture of NCC, epilepsy is the most frequent manifestation of parenchymal NCC, whereas",
    "Neurocysticercosis and oncogenesis.\tRecent studies suggest that neurocysticercosis may be a risk factor for human cancer. Pathogenetic mechanisms explaining possible oncogenic effects of cysticerci include the following: (a) parasite-induced modulation of the host immune response that may be associated with loss of regulatory mechanisms implicated in the immunological surveillance against cancer; (b) transfer of genetic material from the parasite to the host, causing DNA damage and malignant transformation of host cells, and (c) chronic inflammation with liberation of nitric oxide and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. Further research is needed to confirm the potential role of cysticercosis in the development of cancer. These studies should determine the presence of cysticercotic factors",
    "Cognitive Changes and Quality of Life in Neurocysticercosis: A Longitudinal Study\tBackground Few studies have focused on the cognitive morbidity of neurocysticercosis (NCC), one of the most common parasitic infections of the central nervous system. We longitudinally assessed the cognitive status and quality of life (QoL) of patients with incident symptomatic NCC cases and matched controls. Methodology/Principal Findings The setting of the study was the Sabogal Hospital and Cysticercosis Unit, Department of Transmissible Diseases, National Institute of Neurological Sciences, Lima, Peru. The design was a longitudinal study of new onset NCC cases and controls. Participants included a total of 14 patients with recently diagnosed NCC along with 14 healthy neighborhood controls",
    "Neurocysticercosis: the enigmatic disease.\tNeurocysticercosis (NCC) is an infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the metacestode larval form of the parasite Taenia sp. Many factors can contribute to the endemic nature of cysticercosis. The inflammatory process that occurs in the tissue surrounding the parasite and/or distal from it can result from several associated mechanisms and may be disproportionate with the number of cysts. This discrepancy may lead to difficulty with the proper diagnosis in people from low endemic regions or regions that lack laboratory resources. In the CNS, the cysticerci have two basic forms, isolated cysts (Cysticercus cellulosae=CC) and racemose cysts (Cysticercus racemosus=CR),"
