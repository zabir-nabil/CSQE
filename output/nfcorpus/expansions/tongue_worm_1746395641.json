    "Tongue worms, also known as linguatulids, are a type of parasitic worm that typically infects the respiratory tracts of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Despite their name, tongue worms do not actually target the tongues of their hosts. Instead, these worms mainly reside in the nasal passages, sinuses, and throat of their hosts, where they can cause discomfort and respiratory issues. Tongue worms have a complex life cycle, involving multiple hosts during different stages of development. These parasitic worms serve as a fascinating yet troublesome part of the ecosystem, showcasing the intricate relationships between different species in the animal kingdom.",
    "A tongue worm is a type of parasitic worm that infects the tongue of various animals, such as dogs, cats, and livestock. These worms are small, slender parasites that attach themselves to the host's tongue and feed on its blood. Infestations of tongue worms can cause pain, discomfort, and sometimes even difficulty in eating or drinking for the affected animal. It is important to regularly check animals for signs of tongue worm infestation and seek veterinary treatment if necessary to prevent any serious health issues."

    "Anisakis simplex: from Obscure Infectious Worm to Inducer of Immune Hypersensitivity\tSummary: Infection of humans with the nematode worm parasite Anisakis simplex was first described in the 1960s in association with the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. During the 1990s it was realized that even the ingestion of dead worms in food fish can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, that these may be more prevalent than infection itself, and that this outcome could be associated with food preparations previously considered safe. Not only may allergic symptoms arise from infection by the parasites (\u201cgastroallergic anisakiasis\u201d), but true anaphylactic reactions can also occur following exposure to allergens from dead worms by food-borne, airborne, or",
    "Sporamin induce apoptosis in human tongue carcinoma cells by down-regulating Akt/GSK-3 signaling.\tWe investigated the effects of sporamin, the major soluble protein with a kunitz-type trypsin inhibitory activity in the root tuber of the sweet potato, on cell proliferation, apoptosis, Akt/GSK-3 signaling and its related genes to provide more insights in the mechanism behind the inhibitory effects of sporamin in a human tongue cancer line Tca8113. In this study, sporamin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in Tca8113 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Consistently, Bax was up-regulated and Bcl-2 was down-regulated in sporamin-treated cells. Furthermore, Akt",
    "Comparative and meta-analytic insights into life extension via dietary restriction.\tDietary restriction (DR) extends the lifespan of a wide range of species, although the universality of this effect has never been quantitatively examined. Here, we report the first comprehensive comparative meta-analysis of DR across studies and species. Overall, DR significantly increased lifespan, but this effect is modulated by several factors. In general, DR has less effect in extending lifespan in males and also in non-model organisms. Surprisingly, the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension via DR than the degree of caloric restriction. Furthermore, we show that reduction in both age-dependent",
    "Disseminated chlorellosis in a dog.\tAn adult dog with ataxia and a lingual mass, previously diagnosed as protothecosis, was euthanized. At the postmortem examination, the lingual mass, regions of the lungs and hilar lymph nodes, liver, mesenteric and sublumbar lymph nodes, and spinal meninges had pronounced green discoloration. Histologically, pyogranulomatous inflammation and algal organisms were found in the tongue, spinal meninges, hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and lung. The algae had cell walls positive for periodic acid-Schiff and cytoplasmic granules. Ultrastructurally, the algae had a well-defined cell wall, stacks of grana and thylakoid membrane, and dense bodies, typical of starch granules",
    "A low-fat, whole-food vegan diet, as well as other strategies that down-regulate IGF-I activity, may slow the human aging process.\tA considerable amount of evidence is consistent with the proposition that systemic IGF-I activity acts as pacesetter in the aging process. A reduction in IGF-I activity is the common characteristic of rodents whose maximal lifespan has been increased by a wide range of genetic or dietary measures, including caloric restriction. The lifespans of breeds of dogs and strains of rats tend to be inversely proportional to their mature weight and IGF-I levels. The link between IGF-I and aging appears to be evolutionarily conserved",
    "Mortality from malignant diseases-update of the Baltimore union poultry cohort.\tWe previously studied mortality up to 1989 in 2,639 members of a local union who had ever worked in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, because they were exposed to oncogenic viruses present in poultry. In this report, cancer mortality was updated to the year 2003 for 2,580 of the 2,639 subjects who worked exclusively in poultry plants. Mortality in poultry workers was compared with that in the US general population through the estimation of proportional mortality and standardized mortality ratios separately for each race/sex group and for the whole cohort. Compared to the US general population, an excess of cancers of the buccal and nasal cavities",
    "Cancer mortality in workers employed in cattle, pigs, and sheep slaughtering and processing plants.\tOBJECTIVES: We studied mortality in two separate cohorts of workers in abattoirs (N=4996) and meat processing plants (N=3642) belonging to a meatcutters' union, because they were exposed to viruses that cause cancer in food animals, and also to chemical carcinogens at work. METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were estimated for each cohort as a whole and in subgroups defined by race and sex, using the US general population mortality rates for comparison. Study subjects were followed up from January 1950 to December 2006, during which time over 60",
    "Dioxins (PCDD/Fs) and PCBs in offal: occurrence and dietary exposure.\tOffals are widely consumed in different cuisines, but information on the occurrence of dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in these foods is sparse. In the first structured investigation of its kind, this study reports levels of these contaminants in commonly consumed offals (n=173) such as lamb, ox, deer and pig's liver, kidneys, tongue and heart, and offal products such as p\u00e2t\u00e9, haggis, tripe and black pudding.
