    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving technology used for patients with severe heart or lung conditions that prevent their organs from working properly. It is a form of life support that provides temporary support by circulating blood outside the body through an artificial lung and potentially an artificial heart to help oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide. ECMO can be a critical intervention for patients who are not responding to conventional treatments and need additional support to give their organs time to heal and function properly.",
    "ECMO, which stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is a life-saving technology used to support patients with severe heart or lung failure. It works by circulating a patient's blood outside of the body through a machine that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. This allows the heart or lungs to rest and heal while the ECMO machine assists with the work of providing oxygenated blood to the body. ECMO is typically used as a temporary measure for patients who are critically ill and not responding to conventional treatments. It can be a complex and resource-intensive intervention, requiring specialized training and a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals to manage the patient's care effectively. Although ECMO carries risks and is not suitable for all patients, it has the potential to save lives in situations where other treatments have failed."

    "ECMO Thirty-nine newborn infants with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure who met criteria for 85% likelihood of dying were enrolled in a randomized trial in which extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy was compared with conventional medical therapy (CMT). Of the 20, 19 survived Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to 'rest.' Heparin was infused continuously to maintain activated clotting time at 200 to 300 seconds.",

    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and conventional medical therapy in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: a prospecti...\tThirty-nine newborn infants with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure who met criteria for 85% likelihood of dying were enrolled in a randomized trial in which extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy was compared with conventional medical therapy (CMT). In phase I, 4 of 10 babies in the CMT group died and 9 of 9 babies in the ECMO group survived. Randomization was halted after the fourth CMT death, as planned before initiating the study, and the next 20 babies were treated with ECMO (phase II). Of the 20, 19 survived",
    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for newborn respiratory failure: forty-five cases.\tAlmost all types of newborn respiratory failure are reversible. However, supportive treatment (oxygen and positive airway pressure) can damage the lung, and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infants. Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to \"rest.\" We have used ECMO in 45 moribund newborn infants; 25 survived. Neonatologists referred patients who were unresponsive to maximal therapy. The right atrium and aortic arch were cannulated via the jugular vein and carotid artery. Heparin was infused continuously to main activated clotting time at 200 to 300 seconds."
