    "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as prostate gland enlargement, is a common condition that affects older men. The prostate gland, which is located below the bladder and surrounds the urethra, tends to enlarge as men age, leading to symptoms such as frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak urine flow, and the sensation of not fully emptying the bladder. Although BPH is not a life-threatening condition, it can significantly impact quality of life if left untreated. Treatment options for BPH may include medication, minimally invasive procedures, or surgery, depending on the severity of symptoms and individual health factors. It is important for men experiencing urinary symptoms to consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management of BPH.",
    "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that affects men, especially as they age. BPH is characterized by the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to symptoms such as frequent urination, difficulty starting or stopping urination, weak urine flow, and the feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder. While BPH is not a life-threatening condition, it can significantly impact a man's quality of life if left untreated. Treatment options for BPH include medications, lifestyle changes, minimally invasive procedures, or surgery in more severe cases. It is important for men experiencing symptoms of BPH to consult with their healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management."

    "Effect of diet and exercise intervention on the growth of prostate epithelial cells.\tEpidemiological studies suggest a positive association between nutrient intake, hyperinsulinemia and risk of Benign prostatic hyperplasis (BPH). This study tests the hypothesis that a low-fat, high-fiber diet and daily exercise would lower serum insulin and reduce the growth of serum-stimulated primary prostate epithelial cells in culture. Serum samples were obtained from eight overweight men before and after the Pritikin residential, 2-week diet and exercise intervention and from seven men who were long-term followers of the low-fat, high-fiber diet and regular exercise lifestyle. The serum was used to stimulate primary prostate",
    "Dietary patterns, supplement use, and the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\tIt has long been appreciated that a healthy lifestyle plays a critical role in cardiovascular health. It is now apparent that the same is true in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prospective cohort data originating from recently published randomized trials on the medical treatment of BPH and prevention of prostate cancer have been invaluable. A growing body of evidence suggests that exercise and the intake of specific macronutrients and micronutrients through regular diet play a beneficial role. Most strikingly, the magnitude of these effects is similar to medical therapies using alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. The use of",
    "Effects of dietary flaxseed lignan extract on symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\tA flaxseed lignan extract containing 33% secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) was evaluated for its ability to alleviate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in 87 subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with repeated measurements was conducted over a 4-month period using treatment dosages of 0 (placebo), 300, or 600 mg/day SDG.

Evaluation of results using different urodynamic parameters.\tWe studied the obstruction-relieving capabilities of transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP) in 32 symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urodynamic studies with pressure-flow analysis were performed before and 6 months after treatment. All 32 patients showed significant improvement of both subjective and objective obstruction parameters. There were few postoperative irritative symptoms and one patient required recatheterization. In conclusion, TVP is a promising modification of performing transurethral resection of the prostate, and it is indeed capable of relieving bladder outflow obstruction.",
    "Lifestyle factors, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and lower urinary tract symptoms.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although age, genetics, and sex steroid hormones play prominent roles in the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), recent epidemiological studies suggest that modifiable lifestyle factors also contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of these conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Lifestyle and metabolic factors associated with significantly increased risks of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms include obesity, diabetes, and meat and fat consumption. Factors associated with decreased risks include physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, and vegetable consumption. Factors for which no clear risk patterns have emerged include lipids and"
