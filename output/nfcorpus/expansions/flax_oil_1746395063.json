    "Flax oil, also known as linseed oil, is derived from the seeds of the flax plant. It is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is a type of omega-3 fatty acid. Flax oil is often touted for its potential health benefits, such as reducing inflammation, supporting heart health, and promoting skin health. When consumed as part of a balanced diet, flax oil can be a valuable addition to help meet your omega-3 fatty acid needs. It can be used in salad dressings, smoothies, or taken as a supplement in the form of capsules. However, it's important to note that flax oil should not be used for high-heat cooking, as it has a low smoke point and can break down when exposed to high temperatures. As with any supplement, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider before adding flax oil to your routine to ensure it aligns with your individual health needs.",
    "Flax oil, also known as linseed oil, is a popular dietary supplement that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It is derived from the seeds of the flax plant and is known for its numerous health benefits. Flax oil is often used as a source of healthy fats, which have been shown to support heart health, reduce inflammation, and improve cognitive function. Additionally, flax oil is a great alternative for those who do not consume fish, as it provides a plant-based source of essential fatty acids. Incorporating flax oil into your diet can be as simple as adding it to smoothies, salad dressings, or using it as a finishing oil for dishes. However, it is important to store flax oil in the refrigerator and consume it within a reasonable timeframe to prevent oxidation and maintain its nutritional value."

    "Effects of Diets High in Walnuts and Flax Oil on Hemodynamic Responses to Stress and Vascular Endothelial Function\tBackground Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood. In a previous article, we showed significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and several markers of inflammation with increasing intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from walnuts and flax. Objective To examine effects of ALA on cardiovascular responses to acute stress, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, and blood concentrations of endothelin-1 and arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Design Using a randomized, crossover study design, cardiovascular responses to acute stress",

DESIGN: Thirty-four participants were randomized into a parallel, controlled trial. SUBJECTS: The participants were adults with type 2 diabetes (age 52.4 +/- 1.5 years, body mass index 32.4 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2), n = 17 men and 17 women). INTERVENTIONS: Participants consumed a selection of bakery products containing no flax (",
    "Omega-3 fatty acids for nutrition and medicine: considering microalgae oil as a vegetarian source of EPA and DHA.\tLong-chain EPA/DHA omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can be co-preventative and co-therapeutic. Current research suggests increasing accumulated long chain omega-3s for health benefits and as natural medicine in several major diseases. But many believe plant omega-3 sources are nutritionally and therapeutically equivalent to the EPA/DHA omega-3 in fish oil. Although healthy, precursor ALA bio-conversion to EPA is inefficient and production of DHA is nearly absent, limiting the protective value of ALA supplementation from flax-oil, for example. Along with pollutants certain fish acquire high levels of EPA/",
    "Effect of flax seed ingestion on the menstrual cycle.\tLignans are a group of phytochemicals shown to have weakly estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties. Two specific lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, are absorbed after formation in the intestinal tract from plant precursors particularly abundant in fiber-rich food and are excreted in the urine. We evaluated the effect of the ingestion of flax seed powder, known to produce high concentrations of urinary lignans, on the menstrual cycle in 18 normally cycling women, using a balanced randomized cross-over design. Each subject consumed her usual omnivorous, low fiber (control) diet for 3 cycles and her usual diet supplemented with flax seed for another 3 cycles.",
    "Flax and Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review.\tBackground. Flax is a food and dietary supplement commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Flax is known for its lignan, \u03b1-linolenic acid, and fiber content, components that may possess phytogestrogenic, anti-inflammatory, and hormone modulating effects, respectively. We conducted a systematic review of flax for efficacy in improving menopausal symptoms in women living with breast cancer and for potential impact on risk of breast cancer incidence or recurrence. Methods. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and AMED from inception to January 2013 for human interventional or observational data pertaining to flax and breast cancer. Results. Of 1892 records,",
    "Consumption of flaxseed, a rich source of lignans, is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.\tPURPOSE: To investigate the association between intake of flaxseed-the richest source of dietary lignans (a class of phytoestrogens)-and breast cancer risk. METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire was used to measure the consumption of flaxseed and flax bread by 2,999 women with breast cancer and 3,370 healthy control women who participated in the Ontario Women's Diet and Health Study (2002-2003). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between consumption of flaxseed and flax bread and breast cancer risk. Confounding by established and suspected breast cancer risk factors, as well as dietary factors, was assessed.",
    "An open-label study on the effect of flax seed powder (Linum usitatissimum) supplementation in the management of diabetes mellitus.\tDiabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia and associated with aberrations in the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid that result in development of secondary complications. Extensive studies have indicated that nutritional therapy plays a pivotal role in the controlling or postponing of development of these secondary complications. Several functional foods have been shown to possess hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. Flax seed (FS) is a functional food that is rich in omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants and is low in carbohydrates. In exploratory studies, FS was incorporated in recipes, which resulted in a",
    "In vitro anti-metastatic activity of enterolactone, a mammalian lignan derived from flax lignan, and down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases i...\tBACKGROUND: Actin cytoskeleton is involved in actin-based cell adhesion, cell motility, and matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs) MMP2, MMP9, MMP11 and MMP14 are responsible for cell invasion in breast cancer metastasis. The dietary intake of lignan from flax seed gets converted to enterolactone (EL) and enterodiol in the human system. Here we show that the enterolactone has a very significant anti-metastatic activity as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit adhesion and invasion and migration in MCF-7 and MDA MB231 cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Migration inhibition assay,",
    "Oxidative stability and shelf-life evaluation of selected culinary oils.\tFour out of eight 'healthier' oils-namely, almond oil, avocado oil, hazelnut oil and macadamia nut oil-studied were rich sources of monounsaturated fatty acids like olive oil. Grape seed oil, rice barn oil (marketed recently), toasted sesame oil and walnut oil contained high levels of essential fatty acids. The order of oxidative stability determined by Rancimat measuring of the induction period at four temperatures (90 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 110 degrees C, and 120 degrees C) was found to be macadamia oil > rice bran oil approximately toasted sesame oil > avocado oil > almond",
    "Exploration of 100 commonly used drugs and supplements on cognition in older adults\tBackground There are conflicting reports and a lack of evidence-based data regarding effects of medications on cognition in cognitively normal older adults. We explored whether use of 100 common medications taken by older adults is associated with longitudinal cognitive performance. Methods A longitudinal observational cohort was used with analysis of data collected September 2005 through May 2011 and maintained in the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set. Participants were aged 50 years or older and cognitively normal (N=4414). Composite scores were constructed from 10 psychometric tests. Scores for each participant reflecting change in the psychometric composite score from the baseline"
