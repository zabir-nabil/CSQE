    "Maple syrup is a sweet and delicious natural product that is derived from the sap of sugar maple trees. It is commonly associated with breakfast foods like pancakes and waffles, but it can also be used as a versatile sweetener in a variety of dishes and recipes. Maple syrup is made by tapping the trees in late winter or early spring when the sap begins to flow. The sap is then collected and boiled down to concentrate the sugars and create the thick, amber-colored syrup that we all love. Maple syrup has a unique flavor profile that is both sweet and slightly caramelized, making it a popular choice for adding a touch of sweetness to both sweet and savory dishes.",
    "Maple syrup is a sweet and delicious syrup made from the sap of sugar maple trees. It is a popular natural sweetener that is commonly used to top pancakes, waffles, and oatmeal. Maple syrup is produced by tapping the trees in late winter or early spring when the sap begins to flow. The sap is collected and then boiled down to create the thick and rich syrup that is loved by many. With its unique flavor and versatility, maple syrup is a staple in many kitchens and is a favorite indulgence for those with a sweet tooth."

    "maple syrup, Fenugreek, maple syrup and the urine of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients all share a characteristic odor originating from a common component, sotolone. Ingestion of fenugreek by mothers during labor resulted in a maple syrup-like odor in their newborn infants, leading to a false suspicion of MSUD. Many alternatives to refined sugar are available, including raw cane sugar, plant saps/syrups (eg, maple syrup, agave nectar), molasses, honey, and fruit sugars. Unrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants, similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain products.",

    "Pseudo-maple syrup urine disease due to maternal prenatal ingestion of fenugreek.\tFenugreek, maple syrup and the urine of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients all share a characteristic odour originating from a common component, sotolone. Ingestion of fenugreek by mothers during labour resulted in a maple syrup-like odour in their newborn infants, leading to a false suspicion of MSUD.",
    "Total antioxidant content of alternatives to refined sugar.\tBACKGROUND: Oxidative damage is implicated in the etiology of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other degenerative disorders. Recent nutritional research has focused on the antioxidant potential of foods, while current dietary recommendations are to increase the intake of antioxidant-rich foods rather than supplement specific nutrients. Many alternatives to refined sugar are available, including raw cane sugar, plant saps/syrups (eg, maple syrup, agave nectar), molasses, honey, and fruit sugars (eg, date sugar). Unrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants, similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain products. OBJECTIVE: To",
    "Arsenic, Organic Foods, and Brown Rice Syrup\tBackground: Rice can be a major source of inorganic arsenic (Asi) for many sub-populations. Rice products are also used as ingredients in prepared foods, some of which may not be obviously rice based. Organic brown rice syrup (OBRS) is used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. We hypothesized that OBRS introduces As into these products. Objective: We determined the concentration and speciation of As in commercially available brown rice syrups and in products containing OBRS, including toddler formula, cereal/energy bars, and high-energy foods used by endurance athletes.",
    "Survey of commercially available chocolate- and cocoa-containing products in the United States. 2. Comparison of flavan-3-ol content with nonfat co...\tA survey of a broad range of chocolate- and cocoa-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of flavan-3-ol monomers, oligomers, and polymers, which can be grouped into a class of compounds called procyanidins. Samples consisted of the three or four top-selling products within the following six categories: natural cocoa powder, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized for percent fat (% fat),",
    "Energy and Fructose From Beverages Sweetened With Sugar or High-Fructose Corn Syrup Pose a Health Risk for Some People\tSugar intake in the United States has increased by >40 fold since the American Revolution. The health concerns that have been raised about the amounts of sugar that are in the current diet, primarily as beverages, are the subject of this review. Just less than 50% of the added sugars (sugar and high-fructose corn syrup) are found in soft drinks and fruit drinks. The intake of soft drinks has increased 5-fold between 1950 and 2000. Most meta-analyses have shown that the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,",
    "Prevalence, symptoms and outcome of constipation in infants and toddlers.\tOBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of constipation in children <or=2 years, describe the symptoms of constipation, and review how often specific interventions were effective. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Of 4,157 children <2 years of age, 185 children had constipation. The prevalence rate for constipation in the first year of life was 2.9%, and in the second year of life, the rate was 10.1%. Functional constipation was the cause in 97% of the children. Boys and girls were affected with equal frequency. Constipation was caused by an underlying organic disease in 1.6% of cases",
    "The effects of high fructose syrup.\tHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become an increasingly common food ingredient in the last 40 years. However, there is concern that HFCS consumption increases the risk for obesity and other adverse health outcomes compared to other caloric sweeteners. The most commonly used types of HFCS (HFCS-42 and HFCS-55) are similar in composition to sucrose (table sugar), consisting of roughly equal amounts of fructose and glucose. The primary difference is that these monosaccharides exist free in solution in HFCS, but in disaccharide form in sucrose. The disaccharide sucrose is easily cleaved in the small intestine, so free fructose and glucose are absorbed from both sucrose and",
    "Fructose intake at current levels in the United States may cause gastrointestinal distress in normal adults.\tOBJECTIVE: Fructose intake has increased considerably in the United States, primarily as a result of increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, fruits and juices, and crystalline fructose. The purpose was to determine how often fructose, in amounts commonly consumed, would result in malabsorption and/or symptoms in healthy persons. DESIGN: Fructose absorption was measured using 3-hour breath hydrogen tests and symptom scores were used to rate subjective responses for gas, borborygmus, abdominal pain, and loose stools. SUBJECTS/SETTING: The study included 15 normal, free-living volunteers from a medical center",
    "Sugar, Uric Acid, and the Etiology of Diabetes and Obesity\tThe intake of added sugars, such as from table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup has increased dramatically in the last hundred years and correlates closely with the rise in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Fructose is a major component of added sugars and is distinct from other sugars in its ability to cause intracellular ATP depletion, nucleotide turnover, and the generation of uric acid. In this article, we revisit the hypothesis that it is this unique aspect of fructose metabolism that accounts for why fructose intake increases the risk for metabolic syndrome. Recent studies show that fructose-induced uric acid",
    "Evaluation of certain food additives. Seventy-first report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.\tThis report represents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, with a view to recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to preparing specifications for identity and purity. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation and assessment of intake of food additives. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of technical, toxicological and intake data for certain food additives: branching glycosyltransferase from Rhodothermus obamensis expressed in Bacillus subtilis, cassia gum, cyclamic acid and its"
