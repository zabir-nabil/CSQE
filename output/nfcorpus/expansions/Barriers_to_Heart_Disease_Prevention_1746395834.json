    "Barriers to heart disease prevention can hinder individuals from taking important steps to protect their cardiovascular health. One significant barrier is a lack of awareness or knowledge about heart disease risk factors and prevention strategies. Without this understanding, individuals may not realize the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and seeking regular medical check-ups.\n\nAnother common barrier is limited access to healthcare facilities or services, which can prevent individuals from receiving timely screenings, diagnostic tests, and treatments. This barrier is especially problematic for marginalized populations and those living in underserved communities where healthcare resources may be scarce.\n\nAdditionally, socio-economic factors such as low income, limited education, and unstable housing can create barriers to heart disease prevention. Affordability of healthy foods, access to safe recreational spaces for physical activity, and availability of preventive healthcare services can all be impacted by these social determinants of health.\n\nCultural beliefs and practices can also play a role in creating barriers to heart disease prevention. Certain communities may have traditions or customs that discourage lifestyle changes or medical interventions that are beneficial for heart health.\n\nAddressing these barriers to heart disease prevention requires a multifaceted approach that involves increasing awareness, improving access to healthcare services, addressing socio-economic disparities, and promoting cultural sensitivity in healthcare delivery. By overcoming these barriers, individuals can take proactive steps to reduce their risk of heart disease and lead healthier lives.",
    "Barriers to heart disease prevention can vary and often pose challenges to individuals and healthcare systems alike. Lack of awareness and education about heart health remains a significant barrier, as many people may not fully understand the risk factors or the importance of prevention measures. Additionally, unhealthy lifestyle habits such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking can create obstacles to preventing heart disease. Access to healthcare services and preventive measures can also be limited for some individuals, especially in underserved or low-income communities. Furthermore, cultural beliefs and societal norms may influence behaviors that contribute to heart disease risk. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, promoting healthy lifestyle changes, improving access to healthcare, and addressing social determinants of health. By recognizing and overcoming these barriers, individuals and communities can take important steps towards preventing heart disease and promoting overall well-being."

    "Barriers to Heart Disease Prevention, Barriers to providing nutrition counseling cited by physicians: a survey of primary care practitioners. Kushner called for a multifaceted approach to change physicians' counseling practices. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of accompanying symptoms the pathology of which is incompletely understood. Recently, evidence for interactions between the intestinal microbiota, mucosal barrier function, and the immune system have been shown to play a role in the disorder's pathogenesis. Acute inflammation is short-term, self-limiting and it's easy for host defenses to return the body to homeostasis. Chronic inflammatory responses are predisposed to a pathological progression of chronic illnesses characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive production of cytokines, dysregulation of cellular signaling and loss of barrier function."

    "Barriers to providing nutrition counseling cited by physicians: a survey of primary care practitioners.\tIn a 1995 pivotal study, Kushner described the attitudes, practice behaviors, and barriers to the delivery of nutrition counseling by primary care physicians. This article recognized nutrition and dietary counseling as key components in the delivery of preventive services by primary care physicians. Kushner called for a multifaceted approach to change physicians' counseling practices. The prevailing belief today is that little has changed. Healthy People 2010 and the U.S. Preventive Task Force identify the need for physicians to address nutrition with patients. The 2010 objective was to increase to 75% the proportion of office visits that included ordering or providing diet",
    "Changes in expression and distribution of claudin 2, 5 and 8 lead to discontinuous tight junctions and barrier dysfunction in active Crohn's disease\tBackground Epithelial barrier function is impaired in Crohn's disease. Aim To define the underlying cellular mechanisms with special attention to tight junctions. Methods Biopsy specimens from the sigmoid colon of patients with mild to moderately active or inactive Crohn's disease were studied in Ussing chambers, and barrier function was determined by impedance analysis and conductance scanning. Tight junction structure was analysed by freeze fracture electron microscopy, and tight junction proteins were investigated immunohistochemically by confocal laser scanning microscopy and quantified in immunoblots. Epithelial apoptosis was analysed in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2010mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick\u2010end labelling",

    "Gut inflammation in chronic fatigue syndrome\tChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of accompanying symptoms the pathology of which is incompletely understood. Many CFS patients complain of gut dysfunction. In fact, patients with CFS are more likely to report a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional disorder of the gut, and experience IBS-related symptoms. Recently, evidence for interactions between the intestinal microbiota, mucosal barrier function, and the immune system have been shown to play a role in the disorder's pathogenesis. Studies examining the microecology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have identified specific microorganisms whose",
    "Pathobiological determinants of atherosclerosis in youth risk scores are associated with early and advanced atherosclerosis.\tOBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses during adolescence and young adulthood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth Study previously reported risk scores to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in young individuals aged 15 to 34 years using the coronary heart disease risk factors (gender, age, serum lipoprotein concentrations, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycemia). In this study we investigated the relation of these risk scores to the early atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: We measured atherosclerotic lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery, and abdominal aorta and the coronary heart disease",
    "Surveillance for morbidity and mortality among older adults--United States, 1995-1996.\tPROBLEM/CONDITION: During the twenty first century, growth in the number of older adults (persons aged > or =65 years) in the United States will produce an unprecedented increase in the number of persons at risk for costly age-associated chronic diseases and other health conditions and injuries. REPORTING PERIOD: 1995-1996. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: This report uses data from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to report on leading causes of death in 1996 (from the National Vital Statistics System), major causes of hospitalization (1996 National Hospital Discharge Survey [",
    "Anti-inflammatory activity of natural dietary flavonoids.\tOver the past few decades, inflammation has been recognized as a major risk factor for various human diseases. Acute inflammation is short-term, self-limiting and it's easy for host defenses to return the body to homeostasis. Chronic inflammatory responses are predispose to a pathological progression of chronic illnesses characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, excessive production of cytokines, dysregulation of cellular signaling and loss of barrier function. Targeting reduction of chronic inflammation is a beneficial strategy to combat several human diseases. Flavonoids are widely present in the average diet in such foods as fruits and vegetables, and have been demonstrated to exhibit a broad spectrum",
    "Dietary polyphenols in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases.\tAllergic disorders encompass skin, food and respiratory allergies. Sensitization to a normally harmless allergen results in the immune system being biased to a predominant T-helper type 2 response. Re-exposure to the same allergen leads to a robust secretion of allergy-related mediators that eventually triggers symptoms. Our understanding of these disorders has enabled the search of therapeutic approaches that can either modulate the sensitization process or impact on allergic mediators, thus helping manage allergic symptoms. Polyphenols are one such class of compounds that are found in foods and plant sources and have been investigated for their anti-allergic effect in different disease models and",
    "The Preventable Causes of Death in the United States: Comparative Risk Assessment of Dietary, Lifestyle, and Metabolic Risk Factors\tBackground Knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight\u2013obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol",
    "Epithelial barrier biology: good fences make good neighbours\tThe external surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the gastrointestinal mucosal membrane, are an important line of defence preventing the invasion of microorganisms and their products. Mucosal immune cells, especially intraepithelial lymphocytes, are involved in maintaining the integrity of these epithelial barriers. They contribute towards the tolerance to commensal organisms, which occupy these same sites, and to the immune responses against harmful organisms and their products. The composition of the microbiota is influenced by immune cells as well as external environmental factors, especially the use of antibiotics and diet. There is an increasing appreciation that the microbiota affects systemic immune responses in addition to"
