    "Starving tumors of their blood supply is a critical strategy in combating cancer. Tumors require a steady blood supply to fuel their growth and spread throughout the body. By cutting off this blood supply, known as angiogenesis, we can essentially starve the tumors, inhibiting their ability to thrive and multiply. Various treatments such as anti-angiogenic drugs and therapies aim to block the formation of new blood vessels that tumors depend on for their survival. This approach not only limits the growth of existing tumors but also prevents the development of new ones. By targeting the angiogenic process, we can disrupt the tumor's nutrient supply chain and weaken its ability to thrive, ultimately improving the chances of successful cancer treatment.",
    "One innovative approach to treating tumors is to target their blood supply, effectively starving them of the nutrients and oxygen they need to grow and survive. This strategy involves disrupting the formation of new blood vessels around tumors, a process known as angiogenesis. By blocking the signals that promote angiogenesis, researchers are able to cut off the tumor's supply of blood, ultimately leading to its shrinkage or even destruction.\n\nSeveral targeted therapies have been developed to specifically interfere with this process, aiming to inhibit the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. These treatments can be used in combination with traditional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation to enhance their effectiveness. By depriving tumors of their blood supply, physicians are able to weaken and ultimately defeat the cancerous cells, providing a promising approach to treating cancer in a more targeted and effective manner."

The disc is avascular, and the disc cells depend on diffusion from blood vessels at the disc's margins to supply the nutrients essential for cellular activity and viability and to remove metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. Insufficient blood supply to the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been proposed to play a role as causative factor in IVD degeneration. Obesity and tobacco are potential risk factors for degenerative IVD disease. High blood cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels are risk factors for atherosclerosis, and could be responsible for a decrease in the blood supply to the already poor vascularized IVD.

    "Nutrition of the intervertebral disc.\tSTUDY DESIGN: A review of the literature on disc nutrition. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the information on disc nutrition in relation to disc degeneration. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: The disc is avascular, and the disc cells depend on diffusion from blood vessels at the disc's margins to supply the nutrients essential for cellular activity and viability and to remove metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. The nutrient supply can fail due to changes in blood supply, sclerosis of the subchondral bone or endplate calcification, all of which can block transport from blood supply to the disc or due to changes in cellular demand. METHODS: A review of the studies",
    "Diet and inflammation.\tThe emerging role of chronic inflammation in the major degenerative diseases of modern society has stimulated research into the influence of nutrition and dietary patterns on inflammatory indices. Most human studies have correlated analyses of habitual dietary intake as determined by a food frequency questionnaire or 24-hour recall with systemic markers of inflammation like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). An occasional study also includes nutrition analysis of blood components. There have been several controlled interventions which evaluated the effect of a change in dietary pattern or of single foods on inflammatory markers in defined populations",
    "The Collateral Network Concept: A Reassessment of the Anatomy of Spinal Cord Perfusion\tOBJECTIVE Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. An anatomical study was undertaken. METHODS Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a low-viscosity acrylic resin at physiological pressures. After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopy",
    "Symptomatic disc herniation and serum lipid levels\tInsufficient blood supply to the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been proposed to play a role as causative factor in IVD degeneration. There is an association between IVD diseases and increased risk of dying of ischaemic heart disease. Obesity and tobacco are potential risk factors for degenerative IVD disease. High blood cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels are risk factors for atherosclerosis, and could be responsible for a decreased in the blood supply to the already poor vascularized IVD. We performed a frequency-matched case\u2013control study to determine the serum levels of patients with symptomatic herniated lumbar disc. We examined the fasting serum lipid levels in 384 subjects who were operated",
    "Classification of age-related changes in lumbar intervertebral discs: 2002 Volvo Award in basic science.\tSTUDY DESIGN: A histologic study on age-related changes of the human lumbar intervertebral disc was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To investigate comprehensively age-related temporospatial histologic changes in human lumbar intervertebral disc, and to develop a practicable and reliable classification system for age-related histologic disc alteration. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: No comprehensive microscopic analysis of age-related disc changes is available. There is no conceptual morphologic framework for classifying age-related disc changes as a reference basis for more sophisticated molecular biologic analyses of the causative factors of disc aging or premature aging (degeneration)",
    "Potential of traditional ayurvedic formulation, Triphala, as a novel anticancer drug.\tThe cytotoxic effects of aqueous extract of Triphala, an ayurvedic formulation, were investigated on human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and a transplantable mouse thymic lymphoma (barcl-95). The viability of treated cells was found to decrease with the increasing concentrations of Triphala. On the other hand, treatment of normal breast epithelial cells, MCF-10 F, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mouse liver and spleen cells, with similar concentrations of Triphala did not affect their cytotoxicity significantly. The drug treatment was found to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and barcl-95 cells in vitro as determined by annexin-V fluorescence and proportion",
    "Putting cancer to sleep at night: the neuroendocrine/circadian melatonin signal.\tPhysiological and pharmacological blood concentrations of melatonin inhibit tumorigenesis in a variety of in vivo and in vitro experimental models of neoplasia. Evidence indicates that melatonin's anticancer effects are exerted via inhibition of cell proliferation and a stimulation of differentiation and apoptosis. A new mechanism by which physiological and pharmacological blood levels of melatonin inhibit cancer growth in vivois via a melatonin-induced suppression of tumor linoleic acid (LA) uptake and its metabolism to the important mitogenic signaling molecule 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Melatonin suppresses cAMP formation and inhibits tumor uptake of LA and its metabolism to 13-HODE via",
    "Differential anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds from extra virgin olive oil identified in human whole blood cultures.\tOBJECTIVE: The olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet protects against cardiovascular disease, which involves inflammatory processes. This study investigated the effects of phenolic compounds found in extra virgin olive oil on inflammatory mediator production by human mononuclear cells. METHODS: Diluted human blood cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of phenolics (vanillic, p-coumaric, syringic, homovanillic and caffeic acids, kaempferol, oleuropein glycoside, and tyrosol) at concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-4) M. Concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 and of the inflammatory",
    "A comparison of the effect of diets containing beef protein and plant proteins on blood lipids of healthy young men.\tThe effect of plant and animal protein on blood lipid levels was investigated in eight healthy normolipidemic men aged 18 to 27 yr. All subjects were fed both plant and animal protein diets in a cross-over design. Each diet was consumed for a 21-day period. Proteins from commonly used plant sources made up the plant protein diet. Beef protein was substituted for 55% of the plant proteins in the animal protein diet. Fasting venous blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study and at 7-day intervals throughout the 42-day study",
    "Pre-diagnostic acrylamide exposure and survival after breast cancer among postmenopausal Danish women.\tAcrylamide is a probable human carcinogen, with industrial contact, tobacco smoking and foods processed at high temperatures as the main routes of exposure. In animal studies oral intake of acrylamide has been related to cancer development, with indications that the increased cancer occurrence especially regards endocrine related tumors. In human epidemiological studies, dietary exposure to acrylamide has also been suggested related to higher risk of endocrine related tumors, like estrogen sensitive breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if pre-diagnostic acrylamide exposure, measured by acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adducts (AA-Hb and GA-Hb"
