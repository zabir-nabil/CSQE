    "Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in the body's energy production and metabolism. It is important for the functioning of the nervous system, muscles, and heart. Thiamine is water-soluble, meaning it is not stored in the body and needs to be regularly replenished through diet. Good food sources of thiamine include whole grains, beans, nuts, and meat. A deficiency in thiamine can lead to a condition known as beriberi, which can cause symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, and nerve damage. Ensuring an adequate intake of thiamine is important for overall health and well-being.",
    "Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is a vital nutrient that plays a key role in energy metabolism and overall health. It is essential for the proper functioning of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, making it crucial for converting food into energy. Thiamine also supports the proper functioning of the nervous system and helps maintain the health of the heart and muscles. Deficiency in thiamine can lead to conditions such as beriberi or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can have serious health implications. Therefore, ensuring an adequate intake of thiamine through a balanced diet that includes sources such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods is important for maintaining optimal health and well-being."

    "Nutritional quality and health benefits of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.): a review.\tChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important pulse crop grown and consumed all over the world, especially in the Afro-Asian countries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and protein, and protein quality is considered to be better than other pulses. Chickpea has significant amounts of all the essential amino acids except sulphur-containing amino acids, which can be complemented by adding cereals to the daily diet. Starch is the major storage carbohydrate followed by dietary fibre, oligosaccharides and simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Although lipids are present in low amounts, chickpea is rich in nutritionally",
    "Dysmenorrhea.\tDysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age. Risk factors for dysmenorrhea include nulliparity, heavy menstrual flow, smoking, and depression. Empiric therapy can be initiated based on a typical history of painful menses and a negative physical examination. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial therapy of choice in patients with presumptive primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives and depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate also may be considered. If pain relief is insufficient, prolonged-cycle oral contraceptives or intravaginal use of oral contraceptive pills can be considered. In women who do not desire hormonal contraception, there is some evidence",
    "Safety considerations and potential interactions of vitamins: should vitamins be considered drugs?\tOBJECTIVE: To examine adverse effects, adverse events, and potential interactions of vitamins in light of their current prevalence of use, and to discuss whether vitamins should be considered over-the-counter drugs or natural health products/dietary supplements. DATA SOURCES: We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search, explored 4 online databases (Medline Plus, Drug Digest, Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database, and the database of the University of Maryland), and examined reference lists of included studies published from 1966 through October 2009. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The studies were reviewed, with an emphasis on randomized",
    "High-fiber foods reduce periodontal disease progression in men aged 65 and older: the Veterans Affairs normative aging study/Dental Longitudinal St...\tOBJECTIVES: To determine whether foods that are good to excellent sources of fiber reduce periodontal disease progression in men. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Greater Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred twenty-five community-dwelling men participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study. MEASUREMENTS: Dental and physical examinations were conducted every 3 to 5 years. Diet was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Mean follow-up was 15 years (range: 2-24 years).",
    "A vegetarian dietary pattern as a nutrient-dense approach to weight management: an analysis of the national health and nutrition examination survey...\tBACKGROUND: Population-based studies have shown that vegetarians have lower body mass index than nonvegetarians, suggesting that vegetarian diet plans may be an approach for weight management. However, a perception exists that vegetarian diets are deficient in certain nutrients. OBJECTIVE: To compare dietary quality of vegetarians, nonvegetarians, and dieters, and to test the hypothesis that a vegetarian diet would not compromise nutrient intake when used to manage body weight. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004) dietary and anthropometric data",
