    "Carcinogens are substances that have been shown to have the potential to cause cancer in humans. These substances can be found in various sources, including environmental pollutants, certain chemicals, radiation, and even some foods and drinks. Carcinogens can damage the DNA in cells, leading to mutations that may result in uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer. It is important to limit exposure to known carcinogens and take steps to reduce the risk of cancer, such as avoiding tobacco smoke, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, and following recommended safety guidelines in the workplace. Understanding the sources of carcinogens and taking preventive measures can help reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.",
    "Carcinogens are substances that are known to have the potential to cause cancer. These can include chemicals, toxins, radiation, and certain viruses. When individuals are exposed to carcinogens, there is an increased risk of developing cancer over time. It is important to be aware of potential carcinogens in the environment and take steps to minimize exposure in order to reduce the risk of developing cancer. It is also crucial for regulatory agencies to monitor and regulate the use of carcinogens in products and industries to protect public health."

    "Lifestyle related causes of cancer and chemoprevention through phytonutrients.\tCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. There are a lot of cancer causing agents which are divided as physical carcinogens, chemical carcinogens and biological carcinogens. But most of the carcinogens or causes of cancer are related to our lifestyle like diet, habit, occupation, radiation and some infection, etc. Chemoprevention is highly necessary to prevent cancer related preterm death. For this besides avoiding the causes of cancer we should concentrate ourselves on our diet. Because, numerous phytochemicals derived from edible plants have been reported to interfere with a specific stage of the carcinogenic process. Many mechanisms have been shown to account for the anticarcinogenic",
    "Bile acids as carcinogens in human gastrointestinal cancers.\tBile acids were first proposed to be carcinogens in 1939 and 1940. On the basis of later work with rodent models, bile acids came to be regarded as cancer promoters rather than carcinogens. However, considerable indirect evidence, obtained more recently, supports the view that bile acids are carcinogens in humans. At least 15 reports, from 1980 through 2003, indicate that bile acids cause DNA damage. The mechanism is probably indirect, involving induction of oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species that then damage DNA. Repeated DNA damage likely increases the mutation rate, including the mutation rate of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Additional",

    "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in smoked food products and commercial liquid smoke flavourings.\tSmoked foods including turkey, pork, chicken, beef and fish products were screened for the presence of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Eighteen commercial liquid smoke flavourings and seasonings were also analysed. Total PAH concentrations in smoked meat products ranged from 2.6 micrograms/kg in a cooked ham sample to 29.8 micrograms/kg in grilled pork chops, while those in fish products ranged from 9.3 micrograms/kg in smoked shrimp to 86.6 micrograms/kg in smoked salmon. Total concentrations of the carcinogenic PAHs (benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, and indeno[1,2,3-c",
    "High colonic pH promotes colorectal cancer.\tConsiderable evidence suggests that the carcinogens or co-carcinogens responsible for the development of colorectal cancer are either bacterially degraded bile acids or cholesterol. It is proposed that a high colonic pH promotes co-carcinogen formation from these substances and that acidification of the colon either by dietary fibre (following its bacterial digestion to short-chain fatty acids) or milk (in lactose-intolerant individuals) may prevent this process.",
    "A single sip of a strong alcoholic beverage causes exposure to carcinogenic concentrations of acetaldehyde in the oral cavity.\tThe aim of this study was to explore oral exposure to carcinogenic (group 1) acetaldehyde after single sips of strong alcoholic beverages containing no or high concentrations of acetaldehyde. Eight volunteers tasted 5 ml of ethanol diluted to 40 vol.% with no acetaldehyde and 40 vol.% calvados containing 2400 \u03bcM acetaldehyde. Salivary acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. The protocol was repeated after ingestion of ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight). Salivary acetaldehyde concentration was significantly higher after sipping calvados than after sipping ethanol at 30s both with (215 vs. 128 \u03bcmol/l",
    "The cooked meat-derived mammary carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine promotes invasive behaviour of breast cancer cells.\tThe cooked meat derived genotoxic carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) induces cancer of the colon, prostate and mammary gland when fed to rats. Epidemiology studies link these tumours to a Western diet and exposure to heterocyclic amines such as PhIP. We have shown that PhIP is also potently estrogenic and have proposed that this hormonal activity contributes to its target site carcinogenicity. We now postulate that the estrogenic properties of PhIP influence metastatic potential. We have used an in vitro assay for cell invasion based upon digestion and migration through",
    "High levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in mate drinks.\tBACKGROUND: Drinking mate has been associated with cancers of the esophagus, oropharynx, larynx, lung, kidney, and bladder. We conducted this study to determine whether drinking mate could lead to substantial exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), including known carcinogens, such as benzo[a]pyrene. METHODS: The concentrations of 21 individual PAHs were measured in dry leaves of eight commercial brands of yerba mate and in infusions made with hot (80 degrees C) or cold (5 degrees C) water. Measurements were done using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, with deuterated PAHs as the surrogates. Infusions were made by adding",
    "Detection of PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) in the milk of healthy women.\tAn increased risk of breast cancer has been observed in women who consume \"very well-done\" meats. Heterocyclic amines are mutagenic and carcinogenic pyrolysis products formed during high temperature cooking of meats. In the present study, human milk samples were analyzed for PhIP, one of the most abundant dietary heterocyclic amine. A protocol was developed with a mixed-mode cation exchange sorbent for the extraction of heterocyclic amines from milk. Milk samples were acquired from healthy Canadian women. With LC/MS analysis and the method of isotope dilution for quantification, levels of PhIP"
