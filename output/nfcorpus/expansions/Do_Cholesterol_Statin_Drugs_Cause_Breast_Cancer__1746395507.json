    "Statins are a commonly prescribed medication used to manage cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. There have been studies examining the potential link between statins and breast cancer, but current research does not suggest a direct causal relationship between statin use and the development of breast cancer. In fact, some studies have even suggested a potential protective effect of statins against certain types of breast cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between statins and breast cancer risk. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional about any concerns regarding medication and its potential impact on health outcomes.",
    "Cholesterol statin drugs are commonly prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. However, there has been conflicting research regarding the potential link between cholesterol statin drugs and breast cancer. Some studies suggest that statins may have a protective effect against breast cancer by reducing inflammation and inhibiting cell growth. On the other hand, other research indicates a possible association between statin use and an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women.\n\nIt is important to note that the available evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to determine the true relationship between cholesterol statin drugs and breast cancer. Patients are advised to consult with their healthcare provider to weigh the potential benefits and risks of statin therapy in their individual situation."

    "Do Cholesterol Statin Drugs Cause Breast Cancer? Emerging evidence suggests that statins may decrease the risk of cancers. However, available evidence on breast cancer is conflicting. We examined the association between statin use and the risk of breast cancer by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published on this subject. Recent studies have suggested that statins could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on disease-specific mortality remains unclear. We evaluated the risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. Preclinical studies have shown that statins, particularly simvastatin, can prevent growth in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. We investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancer-specific, or all-cause, mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. Mechanistic studies largely support the chemopreventive potential of statins. Results of epidemiologic studies investigating statin use and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent. We investigated the relationship between long-term statin use and breast cancer risk using data from a population-based case-control study of breast cancer.",

    "Statin use and risk of breast cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.\tEmerging evidence suggests that statins' may decrease the risk of cancers. However, available evidence on breast cancer is conflicting. We, therefore, examined the association between statin use and risk of breast cancer by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published regarding this subject. PubMed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for epidemiological studies published up to January 2012, investigating the relationship between statin use and breast cancer. Before meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Combined relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI)",
    "Statin Use and Breast Cancer Survival: A Nationwide Cohort Study from Finland\tRecent studies have suggested that statins, an established drug group in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on disease-specific mortality remains unclear. We evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. The study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Finland during 1995\u20132003 (31,236 cases), identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription database. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users",
    "Statin use after diagnosis of breast cancer and survival: a population-based cohort study.\tBACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that statins, particularly simvastatin, can prevent growth in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. We investigated whether statins used after breast cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of breast cancer-specific, or all-cause, mortality in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. METHODS: A cohort of 17,880 breast cancer patients, newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, was identified from English cancer registries (from the National Cancer Data Repository). This cohort was linked to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, providing prescription records, and to the Office of",
    "Women and statin use: a women's health advocacy perspective.\tThis paper is based on a longer report on the benefits, safety and modalities of information representation with regard to women and statin use, situated within the historical context of Women's Health Movement which has advocated for unbiased, appropriate medical research and prescribing for women based on the goals of full-disclosure, informed consent, evidence-based medicine and gender-based analysis. The evidence base for prescribing statins for women, especially for primary prevention is weak, yet Canadian data suggest that half of all prescriptions are for women. Safety meta-analyses do not disaggregate for women; do not consider female vulnerability",
    "The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy in people at low risk of vascular disease: meta-analysis of individual data from 27 randomised trials\tSummary Background Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent vascular events, but their net effects in people at low risk of vascular events remain uncertain. Methods This meta-analysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n=134\u2008537; mean LDL cholesterol difference 1\u00b708 mmol/L; median follow-up 4\u00b78 years) and five trials of more versus less statin (n=39\u2008612; difference 0\u00b751 mmol/L; 5\u00b71 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal",
    "Long-term statin use and risk of ductal and lobular breast cancer among women 55-74 years of age\tBackground Mechanistic studies largely support the chemopreventive potential of statins. However, results of epidemiologic studies investigating statin use and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent and lacked the ability to evaluate long-term statin use. Materials and Methods We utilized data from a population-based case-control study of breast cancer conducted in the Seattle-Puget Sound region to investigate the relationship between long-term statin use and breast cancer risk. 916 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and 1,068 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases 55-74 years of age diagnosed between 2000 and",
    "Men with Low Serum Cholesterol Have a Lower Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer in the Placebo Arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial\tBackground Several prospective studies suggest that use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs is inversely associated with advanced stage and possibly high-grade prostate cancer. One study reported that men with low cholesterol had a lower risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Given these findings, we investigated the association between low serum cholesterol and prostate cancer risk in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). Methods We conducted a cohort study of 5,586 men aged \u2265 55 years old who were randomized to the placebo arm of the PCPT between 1993 and 1996. Serum",
    "Elevated Levels of Cholesterol-Rich Lipid Rafts in Cancer Cells Are Correlated with Apoptosis Sensitivity Induced by Cholesterol-Depleting Agents\tLipid rafts/caveolae are membrane platforms for signaling molecules that regulate various cellular functions, including cell survival. To better understand the role of rafts in tumor progression and therapeutics, we investigated the effect of raft disruption on cell viability and compared raft levels in human cancer cell lines versus their normal counterparts. Here, we report that cholesterol depletion using methyl-\u03b2 cyclodextrin caused anoikis-like apoptosis, which in A431 cells involved decreased raft levels, Bcl-xL down-regulation, caspase-3 activation, and Akt inactivation regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor activation.",
    "Management of grapefruit-drug interactions.\tGrapefruit is a healthy addition to a well-balanced diet. However, the fruit has been shown to affect the metabolism of many medications, increasing the risk of toxicity and adverse effects. Characteristics of oral medications that may interact with grapefruit include extensive metabolism through the intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 system, low bioavailability, and a narrow therapeutic index. Prominent medications known to interact with grapefruit include statins, antiarrhythmic agents, immunosuppressive agents, and calcium channel blockers. There are equally effective alternatives to these drug classes that do not have the potential to interact with grapefruit. These alternative drugs may be substituted if a patient experiences or is at risk",
    "What is the role of advanced lipoprotein analysis in practice?\tSome practitioners use advanced lipoprotein analysis with the goal of better predicting risk and individualizing lifestyle and drug therapy for cardiovascular prevention. Unfortunately, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle number and size, other lipoprotein subfractionation, apolipoproteins B and A, and lipoprotein(a) have not yet met current standards for biomarker evaluation, and it remains to be determined whether these tests incrementally add to cardiovascular risk predicted by traditional risk factors. More importantly, it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by, or targeting, these measures improve cardiovascular outcomes. Drug therapies known to alter"
