    "Ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. This essential nutrient is not produced by the human body, so it must be obtained through dietary sources such as fruits and vegetables. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, supporting the immune system and promoting healthy skin. It also aids in the absorption of iron and supports the production of collagen, a protein that helps maintain healthy connective tissues. Ensuring an adequate intake of ascorbic acid through a balanced diet is essential for optimal health and vitality.",
    "Ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the growth and repair of tissues in the body. It is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Ascorbic acid plays a vital role in the immune system, helping to boost immunity and fight off infections. It is also important for the production of collagen, a protein that is necessary for the health of skin, bones, and blood vessels. Good food sources of ascorbic acid include citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, and broccoli.

    "ascorbic acid The kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation in amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) as well as in pure ascorbic acid solutions at initial concentrations present in amla over a temperature range of 50-120 degrees C (steady-state temperature) has been studied. The ascorbic acid degradation followed first-order reaction kinetics where the rate constant increased with an increase in temperature. The inhibitory effect [on iron absorption] was overcome by 30 mg ascorbic acid. A significant (p < 0.05) increase in the ascorbic acid content in the plasma was observed after intake of both BJs. The present study was conducted to determine the concentrations of ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phylloquinone, and tocopherols in 25 commercially available microgreens.",
    "ascorbic acid A study on degradation kinetics of ascorbic acid in amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) during cooking. The kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation in amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) as well as in pure ascorbic acid solutions at initial concentrations present in amla over a temperature range of 50-120 degrees C has been studied. The ascorbic acid degradation followed first-order reaction kinetics where the rate constant increased with an increase in temperature. Ascorbic acid prevents the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of polyphenols and phytates on nonheme-iron absorption. The inhibitory effect was overcome by 30 mg ascorbic acid. The inhibitory effects of tannic acid were also dose dependent. The present study was designed to evaluate the possible effect of the consumption of blackberry juices (BJ) prepared with water (BJW) and defatted milk (BJM) on the plasma antioxidant capacity and the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. A significant increase in the ascorbic acid content in the plasma was observed after intake of both BJs."

    "A study on degradation kinetics of ascorbic acid in amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) during cooking.\tThe kinetics of ascorbic acid degradation in amla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) as well as in pure ascorbic acid solutions at initial concentrations present in amla over a temperature range of 50-120 degrees C (steady-state temperature) has been studied. The ascorbic acid degradation followed first-order reaction kinetics where the rate constant increased with an increase in temperature. The temperature dependence of degradation was adequately modeled by the Arrhenius equation. The activation energies were found to be 4.09 kcal/mole for amla and 4.49 kcal/mole for pure vitamin solution. The degradation kinetics of ascorbic",
    "The effects of fruit juices and fruits on the absorption of iron from a rice meal.\tThe effects of the chemical composition of fruit juices and fruit on the absorption of iron from a rice (Oryza sativa) meal were measured in 234 parous Indian women, using the erythrocyte utilization of radioactive Fe method. The corrected geometric mean Fe absorptions with different juices varied between 0.040 and 0.129, with the variation correlating closely with the ascorbic acid contents of the juices (rs 0.838, P less than 0.01). Ascorbic acid was not the only organic acid responsible for the promoting effects of citrus fruit juices on Fe absorption. Fe absorption from laboratory 'orange juice' (100",
    "Effect of ascorbic acid and green tea on endogenous formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopiperidine in humans.\tMany constituents present in the human diet may inhibit endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC). Studies with human volunteers showed inhibiting effects of intake of ascorbic acid and green tea consumption on nitrosation using the N-nitrosoproline test. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ascorbic acid and green tea on urinary excretion of carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) in humans. Twenty-five healthy female volunteers consumed a fish meal rich in amines as nitrosatable precursors in combination with intake of nitrate-",
    "Ascorbic acid prevents the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of polyphenols and phytates on nonheme-iron absorption.\tThe effects of maize-bran phytate and of a polyphenol (tannic acid) on iron absorption from a white-bread meal were tested in 199 subjects. The phytate content was varied by adding different concentrations of phytate-free and ordinary maize bran. Iron absorption decreased progressively when maize bran containing increasing amounts of phytate phosphorous (phytate P) (from 10 to 58 mg) was given. The inhibitory effect was overcome by 30 mg ascorbic acid. The inhibitory effects of tannic acid (from 12 to 55 mg) were also dose dependent. Studies suggested that greater",
