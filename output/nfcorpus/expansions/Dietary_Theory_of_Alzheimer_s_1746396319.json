    "The Dietary Theory of Alzheimer's suggests that the foods we eat play a crucial role in the development and progression of this neurodegenerative disease. Research has shown that certain dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's. These foods are high in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to protect the brain from damage and support cognitive function. In contrast, diets high in saturated fats, sugar, and processed foods have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's. Making healthy dietary choices, combined with regular physical activity and mental stimulation, may offer potential benefits in preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "The Dietary Theory of Alzheimer's disease suggests that certain dietary patterns may play a role in the development and progression of this neurodegenerative condition. Research indicates that a diet high in processed foods, saturated fats, and sugars may contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which are factors known to be associated with Alzheimer's. On the other hand, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats such as those found in fish and nuts, may have protective effects against Alzheimer's by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that support brain health. While more research is needed to fully understand the impact of diet on Alzheimer's, adopting a healthy, balanced diet is generally considered beneficial for overall brain health and may help reduce the risk of developing this devastating disease."

    "Reversing heart disease in the new millennium--the Fleming unified theory.\tNineteen people without prior history of documented heart disease were studied for 8 months to determine the effect of treatment based on an immunologic unified theory of vascular disease. Subjects underwent myocardial perfusion imaging to quantify the extent and severity of coronary artery disease, along with assessment of wall motion abnormalities and ejection fraction by both nuclear and echocardiographic methods. These tests were repeated at the end of the study. Treatment consisted of dietary changes, treatment of cholesterol, triglycerides, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and infection. Patients who followed the dietary recommendations demonstrated statistically reduced disease in",
    "Monoamine theories of depression: historical impact on biomedical research.\tMonoamine theories associate depression with reduced brain monoamine levels. These theories achieved broad popularity in the mid-1960s. The present article reviews the historical development of monoamine theories and their subsequent impact on biomedical research. Alleged divisions between West European and US researchers over competing versions of the theories are investigated using bibliometrics. Subsequently, the application of monoamine theories in the NIMH Collaborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression is covered. The article argues that the impact of monoamine theories is best explained by the ability of researchers, governmental agencies, and pharmaceutical companies to invoke theories that advance various projects and agendas.",
    "The Free Radical Theory of Aging Revisited: The Cell Signaling Disruption Theory of Aging\tSignificance: The free radical theory of aging has provided a theoretical framework for an enormous amount of work leading to significant advances in our understanding of aging. Up to the turn of the century, the theory received abundant support from observations coming from fields as far apart as comparative physiology or molecular biology. Recent Advances: Work from many laboratories supports the theory, for instance showing that overexpression of antioxidant enzymes results in increases in life-span. But other labs have shown that in some cases, there is an increased oxidative stress and increased longevity. The discovery that free radicals can not only",
    "Dietary links to Alzheimer's disease: 1999 update.\tWith the republication of Grant (18), the first paper providing epidemiologic evidence linking diet to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is an appropriate time to review the findings and hypotheses therein in light of the subsequent literature. The main findings, that dietary fat and energy in old age are high risk factors, while fish and cereals are risk-reduction factors, have been supported in various recent epidemiologic studies. Diet contributes to the development of AD through modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, which is also linked to oxidative stress, but may also arise from series 2 prostaglandins. Thus, as",
    "Commercial conspiracy theories: a pilot study\tThere are many ways to categorise conspiracy theories. In the present study, we examined individual and demographic predictors of beliefs in commercial conspiracy theories among a British sample of over 300 women and men. Results showed many people were cynical and sceptical with regard to advertising tricks, as well as the tactics of organisations like banks and alcohol, drug and tobacco companies. Beliefs sorted into four identifiable clusters, labelled sneakiness, manipulative, change-the-rules and suppression/prevention. The high alpha for the overall scale suggested general beliefs in commercial conspiracy. Regressions suggested that those people who were less religious, more left-wing, more",
    "The antiaging approach for the treatment of dry eye.\tDry eye is one of the most common eye disorders affecting millions of people. It causes ocular irritation or discomfort, and decreases functional vision, causing a dramatic deterioration in the quality of life. Although new treatments such as the P2Y2 agonist or cyclosporine eye drops have been developed and a certain level of patient satisfaction can now be obtained, no fundamental treatment has been developed. Currently, there is no therapy available to recover lacrimal function to its normal status. Recent progress in the understanding of aging has laid the foundations for a new way of thinking about intervention of the aging process. Because dry eye is accelerated by",
    "Antidepressants and the Placebo Effect\tAntidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect. Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most",
    "Trends in diet and Alzheimer's disease during the nutrition transition in Japan and developing countries.\tBACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) rates in Japan and developing countries have risen rapidly in recent years. Researchers have associated factors such as the Western diet, obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking with risk of AD. OBJECTIVE: This paper evaluates whether the dietary transition might explain the rising trend of AD prevalence in Japan and in developing countries, evaluating other factors when possible. METHODS: This study used two approaches to see whether dietary or other changes could explain AD trends in Japan and developing countries. One approach involved comparing trends of AD in Japan with changes in national",
    "Dietary protein and bone health: harmonizing conflicting theories.\tA precise understanding of the role of dietary protein in bone health has been evasive despite decades of research. It is known that a dietary acid load is harmful to bone, and sulfur-containing amino acids are metabolized to provide such an acid load. It is also known that protein elevates urine calcium loss. However, recent clinical studies and a meta-analysis have indicated either no effect or a modest benefit associated with higher protein intakes. These contradictory considerations may be explained by the existence of a two-faced relationship between protein and bone, with simultaneous positive and negative pathways. In opposition to the negative effects",
    "Is there a legacy of the U.S. Public Health Syphilis Study at Tuskegee in HIV/AIDS-related beliefs among heterosexual African-Americans and Latinos?\tKnowledge of the US Public Health Syphilis Study at Tuskegee is sometime cited as a principal reason for the relatively low participation rates seen among racial/ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, in biomedical research. However, only a few studies have actually explored this possibility. We use data from a random digit dial telephone survey of 510 African-Americans and 253 Latinos, age 18 to 45 years, to investigate associations between knowledge of the USPHS Syphilis Study at Tuskegee and endorsement of HIV/AIDS conspiracy theories.
