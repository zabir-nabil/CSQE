    "Plant-based diets have been increasingly studied and recommended for managing psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Research suggests that consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds may help reduce inflammation in the body, which can in turn improve the symptoms of psoriasis. Plant-based diets are typically high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which can support overall skin health and immune function. By avoiding or minimizing animal products, processed foods, and refined sugars, individuals with psoriasis may experience fewer flare-ups and better disease management. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian before making significant changes to your diet to ensure you are meeting your nutritional needs while following a plant-based approach for psoriasis management.",
    "Plant-based diets have gained popularity for their potential benefits in managing various health conditions, including psoriasis. Research suggests that eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds may help reduce inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in psoriasis flare-ups. These foods are high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support overall skin health and may help alleviate symptoms of psoriasis.\n\nFurthermore, plant-based diets are typically low in saturated fats and high in fiber, which can promote a healthy gut microbiome. Since the gut plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation and immune responses, maintaining a balanced gut environment through a plant-based diet may help in managing psoriasis symptoms.\n\nWhile individual responses to dietary changes can vary, incorporating more plant-based foods into your meals and reducing processed and inflammatory foods may be worth considering as part of a holistic approach to managing psoriasis. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist before making significant changes to your diet to ensure that your nutritional needs are met and that you are supporting your overall health effectively."

    "Plant-Based Diets for Psoriasis, The focus of this article is to review the relation between vegetarian diets and obesity, particularly as they relate to childhood obesity. Epidemiologic studies indicate that vegetarian diets are associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and a lower prevalence of obesity in adults. Large prospective trials have demonstrated that populations following plant-based diets, particularly vegetarian and vegan diets, are at lower risk for ischemic heart disease mortality. The investigators reviewed the published scientific research to determine the effectiveness of plant-based diets in modifying plasma lipid concentrations. This is a review of the side-effects of cyclosporin A (CyA) in patients with severe psoriasis. In particular, paraesthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia and gastrointestinal disorders may occur, but are generally transient, mild-to-moderate in severity. Curcumin derived from the tropical plant Curcuma longa has a long history of use as a dietary agent. The preventive and therapeutic properties of curcumin are associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties.",

    "Molecular mechanisms of curcumin action: gene expression.\tCurcumin derived from the tropical plant Curcuma longa has a long history of use as a dietary agent, food preservative, and in traditional Asian medicine. It has been used for centuries to treat biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorders, rheumatism, and sinusitis. The preventive and therapeutic properties of curcumin are associated with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Extensive research over several decades has attempted to identify the molecular mechanisms of curcumin action. Curcumin modulates numerous molecular targets by altering their gene expression, signaling pathways, or through direct interaction. Curcumin regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines (",
    "Plant foods and plant-based diets: protective against childhood obesity?\tThe objective of this article is to review the epidemiologic literature examining the role of plant foods and plant-based diets in the prevention of childhood obesity. Available data suggest a protective effect of ready-to-eat cereal on risk of obesity, although prospective studies are still needed. Studies on fruit and vegetables; grains other than cereal; high-protein foods, including beans, legumes, and soy; fiber; and plant-based dietary patterns are inconsistent or generally null. The evidence base is limited, and most studies are fraught with methodologic limitations, including cross-sectional design, inadequate",
    "Side-effect profile of cyclosporin A in patients treated for psoriasis.\tThis is a review of the side-effects of cyclosporin A (CyA) in patients with severe psoriasis; renal dysfunction and hypertension are discussed elsewhere. In particular, paraesthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia and gastrointestinal disorders may occur, but are generally transient, mild-to-moderate in severity and only rarely require discontinuation of CyA. Infections are not a problem. As expected with an immunosuppressive drug, there is the possible risk of tumour development, particularly squamous cell carcinomas. However, these skin malignancies developed almost exclusively in patients previously treated with PUVA and/or methotrexate. The few lymphoproliferative disorders regressed spontaneously on",
    "Effects of plant-based diets on plasma lipids.\tDyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Current guidelines recommend diet as first-line therapy for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. However, what constitutes an optimal dietary regimen remains a matter of controversy. Large prospective trials have demonstrated that populations following plant-based diets, particularly vegetarian and vegan diets, are at lower risk for ischemic heart disease mortality. The investigators therefore reviewed the published scientific research to determine the effectiveness of plant-based diets in modifying plasma lipid concentrations. Twenty-seven randomized controlled and observational trials were included. Of the 4 types of plant",
    "Curcumin: getting back to the roots.\tThe use of turmeric, derived from the root of the plant Curcuma longa, for treatment of different inflammatory diseases has been described in Ayurveda and in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. The active component of turmeric responsible for this activity, curcumin, was identified almost two centuries ago. Modern science has revealed that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., NF-kappaB, AP-1, Egr-1, beta-catenin, and PPAR-gamma), enzymes (e.g., COX2, 5-LOX, iNOS, and hemeoxygenase-1), cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin",
    "Resolving the Coronary Artery Disease Epidemic Through Plant-Based Nutrition.\tThe world's advanced countries have easy access to plentiful high-fat food; ironically, it is this rich diet that produces atherosclerosis. In the world's poorer nations, many people subsist on a primarily plant-based diet, which is far healthier, especially in terms of heart disease. To treat coronary heart disease, a century of scientific investigation has produced a device-driven, risk factor-oriented strategy. Nevertheless, many patients treated with this approach experience progressive disability and death. This strategy is a rear-guard defensive one. In contrast, compelling data from nutritional studies, population surveys",

    "Vegetarian diets and childhood obesity prevention.\tThe increased prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity is not unique to industrialized societies; dramatic increases are occurring in urbanized areas of developing countries. In light of the consensus that obesity is a significant public health concern and that many weight-loss interventions have been unsuccessful in the long term, an exploration of food patterns that are beneficial in the primary prevention of obesity is warranted. The focus of this article is to review the relation between vegetarian diets and obesity, particularly as they relate to childhood obesity. Epidemiologic studies indicate that vegetarian diets are associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and a lower prevalence of obesity in adults",
    "The Garden of Eden--plant based diets, the genetic drive to conserve cholesterol and its implications for heart disease in the 21st century.\tIt is likely that plant food consumption throughout much of human evolution shaped the dietary requirements of contemporary humans. Diets would have been high in dietary fiber, vegetable protein, plant sterols and associated phytochemicals, and low in saturated and trans-fatty acids and other substrates for cholesterol biosynthesis. To meet the body's needs for cholesterol, we believe genetic differences and polymorphisms were conserved by evolution, which tended to raise serum cholesterol levels. As a result modern man, with a radically different diet and lifestyle, especially in middle age,",
