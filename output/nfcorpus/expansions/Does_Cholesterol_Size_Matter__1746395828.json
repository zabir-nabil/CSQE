    "Cholesterol size does indeed matter when it comes to overall health. While cholesterol itself is essential for various bodily functions, the size of cholesterol particles can impact its effects on the body. Generally, smaller, denser cholesterol particles are considered more harmful as they are more prone to build up in the arteries, leading to a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. On the other hand, larger, fluffy cholesterol particles are typically less harmful and may even be protective against heart disease. Therefore, paying attention to the size of cholesterol particles can provide important insights into an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular problems and may influence recommendations for lifestyle changes or medical interventions.",
    "Cholesterol size does indeed matter when it comes to heart health. There are two main types of cholesterol particles: small, dense particles and large, buoyant particles. The small, dense particles are often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol because they are more likely to cause plaque buildup in the arteries, leading to a higher risk of heart disease. On the other hand, the large, buoyant particles are considered \"good\" cholesterol as they can help remove cholesterol from the arteries and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nTherefore, it is important to not only consider the total cholesterol levels but also pay attention to the size and type of cholesterol particles present in the body. A healthy balance of cholesterol size, with a higher proportion of large, buoyant particles, is crucial for maintaining good heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. By focusing on maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle changes, one can effectively manage cholesterol levels and promote overall heart health."

    "Does Cholesterol Size Matter? The primary aim of this study was to investigate how serving styles of snack vegetables appeal to children, focusing on size and shape. One hundred and thirty-eight children aged 9-12 years indicated their liking for a snack meal comprising a combination of carrots, cucumber, and red pepper presented in eight different serving styles: two sizes; small and ordinary. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measures the number and size of lipoprotein particles, instead of their cholesterol or triglyceride content, but its clinical utility is uncertain. Baseline lipoproteins were measured by NMR in 27,673 initially healthy women followed for incident cardiovascular disease, adjusting for non-lipid risk factors. We therefore wished to determine whether reported inconsistencies in the effect of wheat bran resulted from differences in particle size or its high gluten content. Two studies were conducted to determine the influence of particle size and wheat protein on serum lipids in subjects consuming breads providing additional dietary fiber and extra protein. The objective was to compare the effects of diets of equal fat content rich in either hard cheese or butter on blood pressure and fasting serum blood lipids. Cheese intake in large amounts lowers LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with butter intake of equal fat content, possibly due to the high calcium content of cheese.",

    "Serving styles of raw snack vegetables. What do children want?\tThe primary aim of this study was to investigate how serving styles of snack vegetables appeal to children, focusing on size and shape. A secondary aim was to investigate children's willingness to participate in fruit and vegetable subscription services at school, and how these could be designed. One hundred and thirty eight children aged 9-12 years indicated their liking for a snack meal comprising a combination of carrots, cucumber, and red pepper. The meal was presented in eight different serving styles: two sizes; small and ordinary, and four shapes; whole/chunk, slices, sticks, and figures (stars",

    "Steam cooking significantly improves in vitro bile acid binding of collard greens, kale, mustard greens, broccoli, green bell pepper, and cabbage.\tBile acid binding capacity has been related to the cholesterol-lowering potential of foods and food fractions. Lowered recirculation of bile acids results in utilization of cholesterol to synthesize bile acid and reduced fat absorption. Secondary bile acids have been associated with increased risk of cancer. Bile acid binding potential has been related to lowering the risk of heart disease and that of cancer. Previously, we have reported bile acid binding by several uncooked vegetables. However, most vegetables are consumed after cooking. How cooking would influence in vitro bile acid binding",
    "Effects of plant-based diets on plasma lipids.\tDyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. Current guidelines recommend diet as first-line therapy for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. However, what constitutes an optimal dietary regimen remains a matter of controversy. Large prospective trials have demonstrated that populations following plant-based diets, particularly vegetarian and vegan diets, are at lower risk for ischemic heart disease mortality. The investigators therefore reviewed the published scientific research to determine the effectiveness of plant-based diets in modifying plasma lipid concentrations. Twenty-seven randomized controlled and observational trials were included. Of the 4 types of plant",
    "Effect of wheat bran on serum lipids: influence of particle size and wheat protein.\tOBJECTIVE: Wheat fiber appears to protect from cardiovascular disease despite its lack of consistent effect on serum lipids. We therefore wished to determine whether reported inconsistencies in the effect of wheat bran resulted from differences in particle size or its high gluten content. METHODS: Two studies were conducted. In one-month metabolic diets, 24 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed breads providing an additional 19 g/d dietary fiber as medium or ultra-fine wheat bran and extra protein (10% of energy as wheat gluten). In two-week ad libitum diets, 24 predominantly normolipidemic subjects consumed breakfast cereals providing",
    "Homeopathy: what does the \"best\" evidence tell us?\tOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for and against the effectiveness of homeopathy. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (generally considered to be the most reliable source of evidence) was searched in January 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Cochrane reviews with the term \"homeopathy\" in the title, abstract or keywords were considered. Protocols of reviews were excluded. Six articles met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Each of the six reviews was examined for specific subject matter; number of clinical trials reviewed; total number of patients involved; and authors' conclusions. The reviews covered the following conditions: cancer",
    "Low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein particle subclasses predict coronary events and are favorably changed by gemfibrozil therapy i...\tBACKGROUND: Changes in conventional lipid risk factors with gemfibrozil treatment only partially explain the reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD) events experienced by men in the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial (VA-HIT). We examined whether measurement of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle subclasses provides additional information relative to CHD risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a prospective nested case-control study of 364 men with a new CHD event (nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death) during",
    "Cheese intake in large amounts lowers LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with butter intake of equal fat content.\tBACKGROUND: Despite its high content of saturated fatty acids, cheese does not seem to increase plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations when compared with an equivalent intake of fat from butter. This effect may be due to the high calcium content of cheese, which results in a higher excretion of fecal fat. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare the effects of diets of equal fat content rich in either hard cheese or butter or a habitual diet on blood pressure and fasting serum blood lipids, C-reactive protein, glucose, and insulin. We also examined whether fecal",
    "Hidden sources of phosphorus in the typical American diet: does it matter in nephrology?\tElevated serum phosphorus is a major, preventable etiologic factor associated with the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of dialysis patients. An important determinant of serum phosphorus is the dietary intake of this mineral; this makes dietary restriction of phosphorus a cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia. The average daily dietary intake of phosphorus is about 1550 mg for males and 1000 mg for females. In general, foods high in protein are also high in phosphorus. These figures, however, are changing as phosphates are currently being added to a large number of processed foods including meats, cheeses, dressings,",
    "Update on the biological effects of ionizing radiation, relative dose factors and radiation hygiene.\tDiagnostic imaging is an indispensable part of contemporary medical and dental practice. Over the last few decades there has been a dramatic increase in the use of ionizing radiation for diagnostic imaging. The carcinogenic effects of high-dose exposure are well known. Does diagnostic radiation rarely cause cancer? We don't know but we should act as if it does. Accordingly, dentists should select patients wisely - only make radiographs when there is patient-specific reason to believe there is a reasonable expectation the radiograph will offer unique information influencing diagnosis or treatment. Low-dose examinations should be made: intraoral"
