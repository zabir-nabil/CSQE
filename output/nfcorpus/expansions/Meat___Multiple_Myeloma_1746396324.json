    "Multiple Myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells, which are a crucial part of the immune system. Studies have shown that there may be a relationship between the consumption of certain types of meat and the risk of developing Multiple Myeloma. Red and processed meats, such as beef, pork, and sausage, have been associated with an increased risk of cancer due to various factors, including the presence of carcinogens formed during cooking processes like grilling or smoking. Additionally, these meats are high in saturated fats, which have been linked to inflammation and cancer development. Therefore, individuals concerned about their risk of Multiple Myeloma may benefit from reducing their intake of red and processed meats in favor of leaner protein sources like poultry, fish, and plant-based alternatives. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations based on individual health factors.",
    "Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The relationship between meat consumption and the risk of developing multiple myeloma has been a topic of interest in scientific research. Some studies have suggested a potential link between consuming red and processed meats and an increased risk of developing multiple myeloma. While more research is needed to establish a definitive connection, it is recommended to consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources to promote overall health and reduce the risk of various types of cancers, including multiple myeloma. As with any health concern, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and advice."

    "Occupation and risk of lymphoma: a multicentre prospective cohort study (EPIC).\tOBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that certain occupations and related exposures may increase the risk of malignant lymphoma. Farming, printing and paper industry, wood processing, meat handling and processing, welding, shoe and leather manufacturing and teaching profession are among the categories that have been implicated in previous studies. The relationship between occupation and malignant lymphoma has been investigated in a large European prospective study. METHODS: We investigated occupational risks for lymphomas in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). The mean follow-up time for 348,555 subjects was 9 years (SD: 2 years). The",
    "A CASE OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA PRESENTING AS A BULLOUS DERMATOSIS\tMultiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell proliferative disorder that produces a monoclonal immunoglobulin protein. The skin involvement and the development of bullous disease are rarely seen features in multiple myeloma. We present a 55-year-old man with a longstanding, large, tense bullous eruption and hypertrophic scars over his body accompanied recently with weight loss and fatique. He had no response to the previous treatments, which included oral glucocorticoids and dapsone. Histologic examination of the lesions revealed subepidermal bullae, while no immunoflourescence staining was observed. In a further detailed labarotory examination, multiple myeloma was detected. After the treatment of multiple myeloma with chemotherapy",
    "Disparities in the prevalence, pathogenesis and progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma between blacks and whites\tThere is marked racial disparity in the incidence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma, with a two to threefold increased risk in blacks compared with whites. The increased risk has been seen both in Africans and African Americans. Similarly, an increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies in blacks compared with whites has been noted after adjusting for socioeconomic and other risk factors, suggesting a genetic predisposition. The higher risk of multiple myeloma in blacks is likely a result of the higher prevalence of the premalignant MGUS stage; there are no data to suggest that",
    "From myeloma precursor disease to multiple myeloma: new diagnostic concepts and opportunities for early intervention.\tSince monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was first described more than 30 years ago, the definition of the entity has evolved. Today, 3 distinct clinical MGUS subtypes have been defined: non-immunoglobulin M (IgM; IgG or IgA) MGUS, IgM MGUS, and light chain MGUS. Each clinical MGUS subtype is characterized by unique intermediate stages and progression events. Although we now have strong evidence that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by a precursor state at the molecular level, there is urgent need to better understand mechanisms that regulate transformation from precursor to full-blown",
    "Consumption of artificial sweetener\u2013 and sugar-containing soda and risk of lymphoma and leukemia in men and women\tBackground: Despite safety reports of the artificial sweetener aspartame, health-related concerns remain. Objective: We prospectively evaluated whether the consumption of aspartame- and sugar-containing soda is associated with risk of hematopoetic cancers. Design: We repeatedly assessed diet in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). Over 22 y, we identified 1324 non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), 285 multiple myelomas, and 339 leukemias. We calculated incidence RRs and 95% CIs by using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: When",
    "Occupational exposure to meat and risk of lymphoma: a multicenter case-control study from Europe.\tSeveral studies have suggested an increased risk of lymphoma among workers exposed to meat, without conclusive evidence. We conducted a multicenter case-control study during 1998-2004 in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain, including 2,007 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 339 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and 2,462 controls. We collected detailed information on occupational history and assessed exposure to meat in general and several types of meat via expert assessment of the questionnaires. The odds ratio (OR) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for ever occupational exposure to meat was 1.18",
    "Cancer in British vegetarians: updated analyses of 4998 incident cancers in a cohort of 32,491 meat eaters, 8612 fish eaters, 18,298 vegetarians, and 2246 vegans\tBackground: Vegetarian diets might affect the risk of cancer. Objective: The objective was to describe cancer incidence in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in a large sample in the United Kingdom. Design: This was a pooled analysis of 2 prospective studies including 61,647 British men and women comprising 32,491 meat eaters, 8612 fish eaters, and 20,544 vegetarians (including 2246 vegans). Cancer incidence was followed through nationwide cancer registries. Cancer risk by vegetarian status was estimated by using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results: After an average follow",
    "Dietary Acrylamide Intake and the Risk of Lymphatic Malignancies: The Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer\tBackground Acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen, is present in many everyday foods. Since the finding of its presence in foods in 2002, epidemiological studies have found some suggestive associations between dietary acrylamide exposure and the risk of various cancers. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate for the first time the association between dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of several histological subtypes of lymphatic malignancies. Methods The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer includes 120,852 men and women followed-up since September 1986. The number of person years at risk was estimated by using a random sample",

Administering a 4g dose of curcumin, we performed a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study, followed by an open-label extension study using an 8g dose to assess the effect of curcumin on FLC response and bone turnover in patients with MGUS and SMM. 36 patients (19 MGUS and 17 SMM) were randomised into two groups:",
    "Multiple myeloma : recent progress in diagnosis and treatment.\tMultiple myeloma (MM) has been the most intractable hematological disease for many years. Recently, basic and clinical research has advanced remarkably and a new therapeutic strategy has been established. The introduction of high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplantation and the availability of molecular-targeted novel agents such as immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors have dramatically changed the treatment strategies for MM. Achievement of a high response rate resulted in the extension of overall survival, but further research and the development of more multimodality therapeutic approaches is warranted to cure this disease."
