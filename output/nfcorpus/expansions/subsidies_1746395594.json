    "Subsidies are financial assistance provided by the government to certain industries, businesses, or individuals in order to help support or promote their activities. These subsidies can come in various forms, including direct payments, tax breaks, or reduced costs for services such as energy or transportation. The intention behind subsidies is often to stimulate economic growth, encourage investment in key sectors, or help vulnerable populations. However, critics of subsidies argue that they can lead to market distortions, inefficiencies, and unfair advantages for the recipients. Overall, subsidies are a complex and controversial aspect of government policy that requires careful consideration and evaluation to determine their effectiveness and impact on the economy.",
    "Subsidies are financial assistance or support provided by the government to specific industries, businesses, or individuals to help them stay competitive, promote economic growth, or achieve certain policy goals. These subsidies can take many forms, including direct cash payments, tax breaks, low-interest loans, or price supports. The rationale behind subsidies varies depending on the sector and the government's objectives. Subsidies are often used to encourage the production of essential goods or services, support struggling industries, promote innovation, protect domestic markets, or reduce the negative externalities associated with certain activities. While subsidies can be a powerful tool for achieving policy objectives, they can also be controversial, as they may distort market dynamics, lead to inefficiencies, create dependency, or favor certain groups over others. It is crucial for governments to carefully design and evaluate subsidies to ensure that they effectively achieve their intended goals while minimizing any unintended negative consequences."

    "subsidies In this article, we study whether changes in food prices are related to cholesterol levels and whether taxes or subsidies on particular foods would be effective in lowering cholesterol levels and, consequently, CVD costs. We find that prices of vegetables, processed foods, whole milk, and whole grains are significantly associated with blood cholesterol levels. Having analyzed the costs and benefits of government interventions, we find that a subsidy of vegetables and whole grains would be an efficient way to reduce CVD.",

    "Food prices and blood cholesterol.\tCardiovascular diseases (CVD) cost Americans billions of dollars per year. High cholesterol levels, which are closely related to dietary habits, are a major contributor to CVD. In this article, we study whether changes in food prices are related to cholesterol levels and whether taxes or subsidies on particular foods would be effective in lowering cholesterol levels and, consequently, CVD costs.

    "Towards a new system of health: the challenge of Western disease.\tOver the last three decades, the concept of Western disease has become well established. Medicine has approached this group of diseases by searching for new cures but has achieved relatively little success. We argue that medicine should now accept the failure of this strategy and place a major emphasis on prevention. The key objective is to change the climate of opinion so that prevention is taken seriously by the general population. The chief activity should be a wide ranging public education campaign so as to persuade people to live a healthier lifestyle. Medicine will require restructuring in order to carry out this work. Medical education needs to"
