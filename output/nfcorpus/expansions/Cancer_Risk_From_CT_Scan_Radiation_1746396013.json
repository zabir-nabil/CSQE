    "CT scans are important diagnostic tools that use X-ray technology to create detailed images of the inside of the body. However, there is concern over the potential cancer risk associated with the radiation exposure from CT scans. While the amount of radiation in a single CT scan is relatively low and generally considered safe, repeated exposure to radiation from multiple scans over time can increase the risk of developing cancer. It is important for patients and healthcare providers to weigh the benefits of undergoing a CT scan against the potential risks, especially for children and young adults who are more sensitive to radiation. In some cases, alternative imaging techniques that do not involve radiation, such as ultrasound or MRI, may be considered to minimize the risk of radiation-induced cancer. Ultimately, the decision to undergo a CT scan should be made based on careful consideration of the individual's medical needs and the potential risks involved.",
    "It is well-documented that CT scans emit radiation, and this has raised concerns about the potential for an increased risk of cancer associated with regular exposure to CT scan radiation. The level of radiation exposure from a CT scan is typically higher than that from a standard X-ray, which has led to studies on the long-term risks of this radiation exposure.\n\nWhile the risk of developing cancer from a single CT scan is relatively low, the cumulative effects of multiple scans over time could potentially increase the risk. Factors such as the type of scan, the age of the individual, and the frequency of scans can all influence the overall risk of cancer associated with CT scan radiation.\n\nPatients should discuss the necessity of undergoing a CT scan with their healthcare provider to weigh the benefits of the scan against the potential risks. In cases where a CT scan is deemed necessary for diagnosis or treatment, steps can be taken to minimize radiation exposure, such as using the lowest possible dose of radiation required to obtain clear images.\n\nIn summary, while the risk of developing cancer from CT scan radiation is a legitimate concern, it is important to consider this risk in the context of the individual's overall health and medical needs. Communication with healthcare providers and an understanding of the potential risks and benefits are essential in making informed decisions about undergoing CT scans."

    "Radiation and chest CT scan examinations: what do we know?\tIn the past 3 decades, the total number of CT scans performed has grown exponentially. In 2007, > 70 million CT scans were performed in the United States. CT scan studies of the chest comprise a large portion of the CT scans performed today because the technology has transformed the management of common chest diseases, including pulmonary embolism and coronary artery disease. As the number of studies performed yearly increases, a growing fraction of the population is exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation from CT scan. Data extrapolated from atomic bomb survivors and other populations exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation suggest that CT scan",
    "Projected cancer risks from computed tomographic scans performed in the United States in 2007.\tBACKGROUND: The use of computed tomographic (CT) scans in the United States (US) has increased more than 3-fold since 1993 to approximately 70 million scans annually. Despite the great medical benefits, there is concern about the potential radiation-related cancer risk. We conducted detailed estimates of the future cancer risks from current CT scan use in the US according to age, sex, and scan type. METHODS: Risk models based on the National Research Council's \"Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation\" report and organ-specific radiation doses derived from a national survey were used to",

It references several early studies that are seldom quoted in radiation research papers, then quantifies the excess lifetime fatal cancer yield attributable to an estimated 6.5 million pediatric abdominal CT scans. The authors highlight an important policy document issued jointly by the National Cancer Institute and the Society for Pediatric Radiology--specifically, its conclusion that a small dose from CT represents \"a public health concern.\" Finally, the article identifies several contentious issues and proposes policy initiatives that",
    "Estimated risks of radiation-induced fatal cancer from pediatric CT.\tOBJECTIVE: In light of the rapidly increasing frequency of pediatric CT examinations, the purpose of our study was to assess the lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to radiation from pediatric CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organ doses as a function of age-at-diagnosis were estimated for common CT examinations, and estimated attributable lifetime cancer mortality risks (per unit dose) for different organ sites were applied. Standard models that assume a linear extrapolation of risks from intermediate to low doses were applied. On the basis of current standard practice, the same exposures (milliampere-seconds) were assumed, independent of age.",
    "CT evaluation of cervical cancer: spectrum of disease.\tInvasive cervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy. The prognosis is based on the stage, size, and histologic grade of the primary tumor and the status of the lymph nodes. Assessment of the stage of disease is important in determining whether the patient may benefit from surgery or will receive radiation therapy. The official clinical staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has led to errors of 65%-90% in stage III and IV disease; the result has been unofficial extended staging with cross-sectional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT). CT is useful in staging advanced disease and in monitoring",

    "11C-choline vs. 18F-FDG PET/CT in assessing bone involvement in patients with multiple myeloma\tBackground Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B cell neoplasm causing lytic or osteopenic bone abnormalities. Whole body skeletal survey (WBSS), Magnetic resonance (MR) and 18F-FDG PET/CT are imaging techniques routinely used for the evaluation of bone involvement in MM patients. Aim As MM bone lesions may present low 18F-FDG uptake; the aim of this study was to assess the possible added value and limitations of 11C-Choline to that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients affected with MM. Methods Ten patients affected with MM underwent a standard",

    "Identification and Importance of Brown Adipose Tissue in Adult Humans\tBACKGROUND Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. In rodents and newborn humans, brown adipose tissue helps regulate energy expenditure by thermogenesis mediated by the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), but brown adipose tissue has been considered to have no physiologic relevance in adult humans. METHODS We analyzed 3640 consecutive 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomographic and computed tomographic (PET\u2013CT) scans performed for various diagnostic reasons in 1972 patients for the presence of substantial depots of putative brown adipose tissue. Such depots were defined as collections of tissue that were more than 4 mm in diameter",

We previously named this activity uptake in supraclavicular area fat (\"USA-Fat\"). We and others have speculated that this uptake exists in metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT). Such tissue might be expected to have varying metabolic activity depending on the ambient temperature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of USA-Fat and its relationship to the outdoor temperature. METHODS: Between July 2001 and June 2002, 1,017 consecutive"
