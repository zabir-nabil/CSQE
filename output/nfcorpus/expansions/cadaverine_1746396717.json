    "Cadaverine is a naturally occurring organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)5CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2. It is a polyamine that is produced by the decarboxylation of the amino acid lysine. Cadaverine is commonly found in decaying animal tissue, hence its name derived from the word \"cadaver.\" Due to its foul odor, cadaverine is associated with the smell of rotting flesh and has been described as putrid or fishy. Despite its unpleasant odor, cadaverine serves important biological functions in certain organisms and is also used in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical research.",
    "Cadaverine is a foul-smelling organic compound that is found in decaying flesh. It is a diamine compound with the chemical formula C5H14N2. Cadaverine is produced by the breakdown of amino acids during the decomposition of animal or plant tissue. Due to its distinctive putrid odor, cadaverine is often associated with the smell of decaying corpses. Its presence is a key indicator for forensic scientists when determining the time of death in a criminal investigation. Despite its unpleasant smell, cadaverine plays an important role in the natural process of decomposition and the recycling of nutrients in ecosystems."

    "cadaverine, The acute and subacute toxicity of five biogenic amines-tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine, and cadaverine-were examined in Wistar rats. Putrescine and cadaverine have been found to be significant in fish safety and quality determination. Putrescine and cadaverine have been suggested to potentiate histamine toxicity. Biogenic amines are non-volatile amines formed by decarboxylation of amino acids. Despite a widely reported association between histamine and scombroid food poisoning, histamine alone appears to be insufficient to cause food toxicity.

    "Acute and subacute toxicity of tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine in rats.\tThe acute and subacute toxicity of five biogenic amines-tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine-were examined in Wistar rats. Tyramine and cadaverine had a low acute oral toxicity of more than 2000 mg/kg body weight. Putrescine had an acute oral toxicity of 2000 mg/kg body weight and spermidine and spermine each of 600 mg/kg body weight. All amines investigated caused a dose-related decrease in blood pressure after intravenous administration, except for tyramine, where an increase was found. In 6-wk studies the biogenic amines were administered in the diet",

    "Determination of biogenic amines in Korean traditional fermented soybean paste (Doenjang).\tBiogenic amines, produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids, have been associated with toxicological symptoms in food products. Twenty-three samples of traditionally available Korean fermented soybean paste samples (Doenjang) were analyzed in order to determine the content of biogenic amines. Amines were extracted with 0.4M perchloric acid and derivatized with dansyl chloride. Nine biogenic amines were separated from Doenjang samples by high performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution (acetonitrile and ammonium acetate), and detected with spectrophotometric UV-vis detection at 254 nm. The pH value of all the samples was ranged from 4.8 to 6.0, and the"
