    "Phytic acid is a compound found in grains, seeds, and legumes that can both be beneficial and problematic for human health. On one hand, phytic acid acts as an antioxidant and is thought to have some anti-inflammatory properties. It can also bind to minerals in the digestive tract, potentially aiding in their excretion and preventing mineral overload. However, phytic acid is also considered an \"anti-nutrient\" because it can inhibit the absorption of minerals such as iron, zinc, and calcium. This can be a concern for individuals who rely heavily on plant-based diets. To mitigate the negative effects of phytic acid, some people choose to soak, ferment, or sprout grains and legumes before consuming them, as these processes can help to reduce the phytic acid content. Ultimately, the impact of phytic acid on health may vary depending on dietary intake and individual nutrient needs.",
    "Phytic acid, also known as inositol hexaphosphate, is a naturally occurring compound found in many plant-based foods such as grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. It is considered an antinutrient because it can bind to minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium, making them less available for absorption by the body. This can lead to nutrient deficiencies if consumed in large amounts over time. However, phytic acid also has antioxidant properties and may have some health benefits, such as reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases. To minimize the impact of phytic acid on mineral absorption, soaking, fermenting, or sprouting foods high in phytic acid can help reduce its levels and improve mineral availability."

    "Phytate in foods and significance for humans: food sources, intake, processing, bioavailability, protective role and analysis.\tThe article gives an overview of phytic acid in food and of its significance for human nutrition. It summarises phytate sources in foods and discusses problems of phytic acid/phytate contents of food tables. Data on phytic acid intake are evaluated and daily phytic acid intake depending on food habits is assessed. Degradation of phytate during gastro-intestinal passage is summarised, the mechanism of phytate interacting with minerals and trace elements in the gastro-intestinal chyme described and the pathway of inositol phosphate hydrolysis in the gut presented. The present knowledge of phytate absorption is summarised and",
    "Suppression of colonic cancer by dietary phytic acid.\tLarge differences exist between human populations in the frequency of colonic cancer. Epidemiological evidence indicates that these differences are strongly influenced by country of residence, and a negative correlation has been found between the fiber content of the diet and frequency of colonic cancer. This has prompted the hypothesis that high-fiber diets are in some way protective. However, reanalysis of the dietary data provides equally strong support for the hypothesis that the protective element may be phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate). This heat- and acid-stable substance is present in high concentration in many food items, including cereal grains, nuts, and seeds. Phytic acid",
    "The role of phytic acid in legumes: antinutrient or beneficial function?\tThis review describes the present state of knowledge about phytic acid (phytate), which is often present in legume seeds. The antinutritional effects of phytic acid primarily relate to the strong chelating associated with its six reactive phosphate groups. Its ability to complex with proteins and particularly with minerals has been a subject of investigation from chemical and nutritional viewpoints. The hydrolysis of phytate into inositol and phosphates or phosphoric acid occurs as a result of phytase or nonenzymatic cleavage. Enzymes capable of hydrolysing phytates are widely distributed in micro-organisms, plants and animals. Phytases act in a stepwise manner to catalyse the hydrolysis of",
    "Dietary suppression of colonic cancer. Fiber or phytate?\tThe incidence of colonic cancer differs widely between various human populations. It has been suggested that dietary fiber content is of utmost importance and is inversely related to the occurrence of colonic cancer. However, high-fiber diets are not always correlated with low frequency of colonic cancer, suggesting the involvement of additional dietary constituents. Inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid) is an abundant plant seed component present in many, but not all, fiber-rich diets. The authors have found that phytic acid is a potent inhibitor of iron-mediated generation of the hazardous oxidant, hydroxyl radical. Herein, the authors propose that inhibition of",
    "Effect of phytic acid on the absorption, distribution, and endogenous excretion of zinc in rats.\tZinc metabolism in male rats was studied by combining nutritional balance methods with an analysis of 65Zn kinetics. The rats, two groups of 84 each, were fed zinc-adequate diets (33 ppm Zn) with either 0 (basal) or 2% phytic acid added as sodium phytate. A fourth-order exponential function described the time-course of 65Zn in plasma, and compartmental models were developed accordingly. Plasma zinc exchanged more rapidly with zinc in liver and kidneys than it did with zinc in testes, skeletal muscle, or bone. Total body zinc content (2.6",
    "Neuroprotective effect of the natural iron chelator, phytic acid in a cell culture model of Parkinson's disease.\tDisrupted iron metabolism and excess iron accumulation has been reported in the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Because excessive iron can induce oxidative stress subsequently causing degradation of nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD, we determined the protective effect of a naturally occurring iron chelator, phytic acid (IP6), on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced cell death in immortalized rat mesencephalic/dopaminergic cells. Cell death was induced with MPP(+) in normal and iron-excess conditions and cytotoxicity was measured by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) and trypan blue staining.",
    "Plant-based foods as a source of lipotropes for human nutrition: a survey of in vivo studies.\tIncreased consumption of plant products is associated with lower chronic disease prevalence. This is attributed to the great diversity of healthy phytochemicals present in these foods. The most investigated physiological effects have been their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic properties. Although less studied in humans, some compounds were very early on shown to be lipotropic in animals, i.e., the capacity to hasten the removal of fat from liver and/or reduce hepatic lipid synthesis or deposits by mainly increasing phospholipid synthesis via the transmethylation pathway for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein exportation from the liver and enhanced fatty",
    "Can rye intake decrease risk of human breast cancer?\tBackground Rye contains more fibre and bioactive compounds than other cereals used for bread production. The fibre and compounds of the fibre complex could provide protection against breast cancer (BC). Objective To review the evidence and theoretical background for a role of rye and some of its components in the prevention of BC. Design A short review based to a great extent on the work by scientists in the Nordic countries. Results Some of the possible mechanisms by which the fibre complex could reduce BC risk are presented. The fibre through its effect on fermentation increases esterification of bile acids reducing toxicity of the free bile acids and is involved",

    "The effect of inositol hexaphosphate on the expression of selected metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated colon cancer cells\tIntroduction Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have repeatedly been shown to play a very active role in extracellular matrix degradation associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are well-known for their ability to inhibit MMP activity thereby inhibiting malignant progression. Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6 phytic acid) has been recognized to have both preventive and therapeutic effects against various cancers including that of colon. In in vitro studies, IP6 has been demonstrated to inhibit cancer cell adhesion and migration. In the present study, the effect of IP6 on the expression of"
