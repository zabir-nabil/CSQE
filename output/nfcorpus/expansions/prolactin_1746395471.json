    "Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, often referred to as the \"milk hormone\" due to its role in lactation. It plays a crucial role in the reproduction system, particularly in the production of breast milk after childbirth. Prolactin levels increase during pregnancy and breastfeeding, stimulating the mammary glands to produce milk. Aside from its role in lactation, prolactin also has various other functions in the body, such as regulating the immune system, metabolism, and behaviors like stress response and bonding. Abnormal levels of prolactin can lead to health issues, including infertility, irregular menstruation, and milk production in non-pregnant individuals. Monitoring prolactin levels is important for maintaining overall health and managing reproductive functions.",
    "Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. It plays a crucial role in the reproductive system, particularly in women. Prolactin is primarily known for its role in stimulating milk production in breastfeeding mothers. However, prolactin also has other functions, such as regulating the menstrual cycle and supporting the immune system. High levels of prolactin can lead to infertility, irregular periods, and lactation in non-pregnant individuals. Monitoring prolactin levels is important for diagnosing and managing various reproductive health issues."

    "Serum prolactin and oestradiol levels in women with cyclical mastalgia.\tBasal serum prolactin and serum oestradiol-17-beta concentrations were measured four times during one menstrual cycle in 20 women with severe cyclical mastalgia and normal to slightly fibroadenotic breasts. A group of 10 normal women who had never experienced mastalgia served as controls. Basal serum prolactin was significantly elevated in patients compared to normals, although within the normal range. Serum oestradiol concentrations did not differ in the two groups and were also within the normal range. A significant positive correlation between oestradiol and prolactin was found in patients and normals, but with larger prolactin levels in patients. The results point towards a prolactin secretory hypersensitivity for oestradiol in",
    "A double blind trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease.\tA double blind crossover trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease is reported. Twenty-nine women with cyclical mastalgia and 11 with non-cyclical pain were treated with bromocriptine, 5 mg daily, and placebo over six menstrual cycels. Assessment of response to treatment was made by a linear analogue system and clinical examination together with plasma prolactin estimations. Bromocriptine produced a significant improvement in breast symptoms and a significant fall in prolactin levels in the cyclical pain group, but had no effect in the non-cyclical group. These results suggest that bromocriptine offers a new and effective approach",
    "Sub-clinical neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with low level of mercury exposure through fish consumption.\tIn order to assess early neurotoxic effects associated with relatively low levels of mercury absorbed through fish eating, two groups of 22 adult male subjects, habitual consumers of tuna fish, and 22 controls were examined using a cross-sectional field study. The assessment included neurobehavioral tests of vigilance and psychomotor function, hand tremor measurements and serum prolactin assessment. Mercury in urine (U-Hg) and serum prolactin (sPRL) were measured in all exposed subjects and controls, whereas measurements of the organic component of mercury in blood (O-Hg) were available for only 10 exposed and six",
    "Upregulation of lymphocyte apoptosis as a strategy for preventing and treating autoimmune disorders: a role for whole-food vegan diets, fish oil an...\tInduced apoptosis of autoreactive T-lymphocyte precursors in the thymus is crucial for the prevention of autoimmune disorders. IGF-I and prolactin, which are lymphocyte growth factors, may have the potential to suppress apoptosis in thymocytes and thus encourage autoimmunity; conversely, dietary fish oil rich in omega-3 fats appears to upregulate apoptosis in lymphocytes. Since whole-food vegan diets may downregulate systemic IGF-I activity, it is proposed that such a diet, in conjunction with fish oil supplementation and treatment with dopamine agonists capable of suppressing prolactin secretion",
    "High-dose ascorbic acid increases intercourse frequency and improves mood: a randomized controlled clinical trial.\tBACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid (AA) modulates catecholaminergic activity, decreases stress reactivity, approach anxiety and prolactin release, improves vascular function, and increases oxytocin release. These processes are relevant to sexual behavior and mood. METHODS: In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 14 day trial of sustained-release AA (42 healthy young adults; 3000 mg/day Cetebe) and placebo (39 healthy young adults), subjects with partners recorded penile-vaginal intercourse (FSI), noncoital partner sex, and masturbation in daily diaries, and also completed the Beck Depression",
    "Identification of peptide hormones of the amphipathic helix class using the helical hydrophobic moment algorithm.\tEisenberg's helical hydrophobic moment (less than mu H greater than) algorithm was applied to the analysis of the primary structure of amphipathic alpha-helical peptide hormones and an optimal method for identifying other peptides of this class determined. We quantitate and compare known amphipathic helical peptide hormones with a second group of peptides with proven nonamphipathic properties and determine the best method of distinguishing between them. The respective means of the maximum 11 residue less than mu H greater than for the amphipathic helical and control peptides were 0.46 (+/-/-0.07) and 0.33 (0.07) (P + 0.004). To",
    "Body fat composition and distribution in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\tOBJECTIVES: The aims of the present study were to compare the distribution and accumulation of body fat in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and healthy controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI), and to investigate the association between androgen levels, insulin resistance and fat distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one PCOS women and 29 age- and BMI-matched healthy control women were evaluated in terms of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness determined with a skinfold caliper and body composition analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Blood samples were obtained for determination of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, 17beta-"
