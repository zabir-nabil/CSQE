    "Cataracts are a common age-related eye condition that can lead to blurred vision and even blindness if left untreated. While there is no guaranteed way to completely prevent cataracts, maintaining a healthy diet rich in antioxidants and nutrients can help reduce your risk. Foods high in vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and lutein such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds can help protect your eyes from damage caused by free radicals and UV exposure. Including foods high in omega-3 fatty acids like fatty fish and flaxseeds can also support eye health. Additionally, staying hydrated and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can further promote healthy vision and reduce the likelihood of developing cataracts. Remember, a balanced diet rich in nutrients, along with regular eye check-ups, is key to maintaining good eye health and preventing cataracts.",
    "Preventing cataracts with diet is possible by including certain key nutrients in your daily meals. Foods rich in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and lutein can help protect the eyes from cataracts. Adding colorful fruits and vegetables like oranges, berries, spinach, and carrots to your diet can provide these important nutrients. Additionally, consuming foods high in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds may also help reduce the risk of developing cataracts. Eating a balanced diet full of these nutrient-rich foods, along with maintaining a healthy lifestyle, can contribute to overall eye health and potentially prevent the formation of cataracts."

    "Diet, vegetarianism, and cataract risk.\tBACKGROUND: Age-related cataract is a major cause of morbidity. Previous studies of diet and cataract risk have focused on specific nutrients or healthy eating indexes but not on identifiable dietary groups such as vegetarians. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between diet and cataract risk in a population that has a wide range of diets and includes a high proportion of vegetarians. DESIGN: We used Cox proportional hazards regression to study cataract risk in relation to baseline dietary and lifestyle characteristics of 27,670 self-reported nondiabetic participants aged \u226540 y at recruitment in the Oxford (United Kingdom) arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC",

Isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane (SFN), are proposed to provide cytoprotection against oxidative stress. We therefore tested the ability of SFN to perform this role in lens cells and establish its ability to delay the onset of cataract. METHODS: The human lens epithelial cell line FHL124 and whole porcine lens culture systems were used. The ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay was used to assess FHL124 cell survival, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis. The MTS assay was used to assess cell populations. To determine levels of",
    "Cataract is a self-defence reaction to protect the retina from oxidative damage.\tAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Cataract extraction is the most common surgical procedure in developed countries. Lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), retinal carotenoids, are the most powerful retinal anti-oxidants and absorb the harmful blue light. The depletion of L+Z induces the development of the lens opacification-cataract. Cataract reduces the retinal oxidative stress (OS), which causes a reduction of the probability to develop AMD. Oxidative Stress at the retinal level is the common pathway in the development of AMD and cataract. AMD",
    "Diet and prevention of oral cancer: strategies for clinical practice.\tBACKGROUND: Oral health care professionals can play an important role in preventing oral cancer by performing oral mucosal examinations to detect pre-cancerous changes and by educating patients about oral cancer prevention strategies, including dietary approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports a diet high in fruits, vegetables and plant-based foods for prevention of oral cancer. Dietary supplements-including vitamins and minerals-have not been shown to be effective as substitutes for a diet high in fruits and vegetables. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In addition to discussing tobacco and alcohol use with patients (and, if relevant, betel nut and gutka consumption),",
    "Effects of Hibiscus sabdariffa extract powder and preventive treatment (diet) on the lipid profiles of patients with metabolic syndrome (MeSy).\tInsulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are strongly associated with metabolic syndrome (MeSy), which is considered to be a reversible clinical stage before its evolution to coronary heart disease and diabetes. Currently, the antihypertensive and hypolipidemic properties of aqueous Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts (HSE) have been demonstrated in clinical trials and in vivo experiments. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a Hibiscus sabdariffa extract powder (HSEP) and a recognized preventive treatment (diet) on the lipid profiles of individuals with and without MeSy",
    "Upregulation of lymphocyte apoptosis as a strategy for preventing and treating autoimmune disorders: a role for whole-food vegan diets, fish oil an...\tInduced apoptosis of autoreactive T-lymphocyte precursors in the thymus is crucial for the prevention of autoimmune disorders. IGF-I and prolactin, which are lymphocyte growth factors, may have the potential to suppress apoptosis in thymocytes and thus encourage autoimmunity; conversely, dietary fish oil rich in omega-3 fats appears to upregulate apoptosis in lymphocytes. Since whole-food vegan diets may downregulate systemic IGF-I activity, it is proposed that such a diet, in conjunction with fish oil supplementation and treatment with dopamine agonists capable of suppressing prolactin secretion",
    "Program and Policy Options for Preventing Obesity in China\tBy 2002, China\u2019s prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults was 18.9 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. The Chinese traditional diet has been replaced by the \u201cWestern diet\u201d and major declines in all phases of activity and increased sedentary activity as the main reasons explaining the rapid increase in overweight and obesity, bring major economic and health costs. The Nutrition Improvement Work Management Approach was released in 2010. Overweight and obesity prevention-related policies were added to national planning for disease prevention and control.

    "Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet.\tBACKGROUND: Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and,",
    "Tumor Angiogenesis as a Target for Dietary Cancer Prevention\tBetween 2000 and 2050, the number of new cancer patients diagnosed annually is expected to double, with an accompanying increase in treatment costs of more than $80 billion over just the next decade. Efficacious strategies for cancer prevention will therefore be vital for improving patients' quality of life and reducing healthcare costs. Judah Folkman first proposed antiangiogenesis as a strategy for preventing dormant microtumors from progressing to invasive cancer. Although antiangiogenic drugs are now available for many advanced malignancies (colorectal, lung, breast, kidney, liver, brain, thyroid, neuroendocrine, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome), cost and toxicity considerations preclude their broad use",
    "Vegetarian diets and childhood obesity prevention.\tThe increased prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity is not unique to industrialized societies; dramatic increases are occurring in urbanized areas of developing countries. In light of the consensus that obesity is a significant public health concern and that many weight-loss interventions have been unsuccessful in the long term, an exploration of food patterns that are beneficial in the primary prevention of obesity is warranted. The focus of this article is to review the relation between vegetarian diets and obesity, particularly as they relate to childhood obesity. Epidemiologic studies indicate that vegetarian diets are associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) and a lower prevalence of obesity in adults"
