    "When it comes to weight gain, several factors can contribute to changes in our body size. Consuming a diet high in calories and low in nutrients, along with a lack of physical activity, are common culprits for weight gain. Hormonal imbalances, certain medications, genetics, and underlying health conditions can also play a role in fluctuations in weight. It's essential to maintain a balanced diet, stay active, manage stress levels, and prioritize healthy habits to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If experiencing unexplained or sudden weight gain, consulting a healthcare professional can help identify any underlying issues and create a personalized plan to address them.",
    "Weight gain can occur for a variety of reasons, including an imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned. Factors such as diet, exercise, genetics, metabolism, and overall lifestyle play a role in determining weight. Consuming more calories than the body needs can lead to weight gain over time, especially if balanced with physical inactivity. It is important to adopt a healthy and balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, and make lifestyle changes to manage weight effectively. Consultation with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist can help tailor a personalized plan to address weight gain and promote overall well-being."

The objective of the present study was to establish possible relationships between gut microbiota, body weight, weight gain, and biochemical parameters in pregnant women. Meat consumption and prospective weight change in participants of the EPIC-PANACEA study. Some observational studies have shown that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain. This paper describes the interplay among energy intake, energy expenditure, and body energy stores and illustrates how an understanding of energy balance can help develop strategies to reduce obesity. Reducing obesity will require modifying both energy intake and energy expenditure and not simply focusing on either alone. The objective of this study is to assess the association between the amount and type of dietary protein, and subsequent changes in weight and waist circumference (WC). Protein is considered to increase thermogenesis and satiety more than other macronutrients, it may have beneficial effects on prevention of weight gain and weight maintenance. Published epidemiologic studies with \u22651-yr follow-up were located. Two published reports from large cohorts (SUN and Nurses Health Study-2) showed inverse associations between frequency of nut consumption and long-term weight changes. Nuts are an integral part of the Mediterranean food patterns, and their incorporation into the regular diets of human beings is believed to provide many health benefits. Nut consumption has been associated with several health benefits, such as antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, cardioprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits.",

    "Weight gain over 5 years in 21,966 meat-eating, fish-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men and women in EPIC-Oxford.\tBACKGROUND: Cross-sectional studies have shown that vegetarians and vegans are leaner than omnivores. Longitudinal data on weight gain in these groups are sparse. OBJECTIVE: We investigated changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) over a 5-year period in meat-eating, fish-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men and women in the UK. DESIGN: Self-reported anthropometric, dietary and lifestyle data were collected at baseline in 1994-1999 and at follow-up in 2000-2003; the median duration",
    "Gut microbiota composition is associated with body weight, weight gain and biochemical parameters in pregnant women.\tObesity is associated with complications during pregnancy and increased health risks in the newborn. The objective of the present study was to establish possible relationships between gut microbiota, body weight, weight gain and biochemical parameters in pregnant women. Fifty pregnant women were classified according to their BMI in normal-weight (n 34) and overweight (n 16) groups. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR in faeces and biochemical parameters in plasma at 24 weeks of pregnancy. Reduced numbers of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and increased numbers of Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli were detected",
    "Increased food energy supply is more than sufficient to explain the US epidemic of obesity.\tBACKGROUND: The major drivers of the obesity epidemic are much debated and have considerable policy importance for the population-wide prevention of obesity. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the relative contributions of increased energy intake and reduced physical activity to the US obesity epidemic. DESIGN: We predicted the changes in weight from the changes in estimated energy intakes in US children and adults between the 1970s and 2000s. The increased US food energy supply (adjusted for wastage and assumed to be proportional to energy intake) was apportioned to children and adults and inserted into equations that relate energy intake to body",

Objective: The objective was to determine the relation between nut consumption and long-term weight change. Design: The participants were 51,188 women in the Nurses' Health Study II aged 20\u201345 y, who had no cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. We prospectively evaluated the dietary intake of nuts and subsequent weight changes from 1991 to 1999. Results: Women who reported eating nuts \u22652 times/wk had slightly less mean (\u00b1 SE) weight gain",
    "Meat consumption and prospective weight change in participants of the EPIC-PANACEA study.\tBACKGROUND: Meat intake may be related to weight gain because of its high energy and fat content. Some observational studies have shown that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain, but intervention studies have shown mixed results. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the association between consumption of total meat, red meat, poultry, and processed meat and weight gain after 5 y of follow-up, on average, in the large European population who participated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home and",

    "Energy Balance and Obesity\tThis paper describes the interplay among energy intake, energy expenditure and body energy stores and illustrates how an understanding of energy balance can help develop strategies to reduce obesity. First, reducing obesity will require modifying both energy intake and energy expenditure and not simply focusing on either alone. Food restriction alone will not be effective in reducing obesity if human physiology is biased toward achieving energy balance at a high energy flux (i.e. at a high level of energy intake and expenditure). In previous environments a high energy flux was achieved with a high level of physical activity but in today's sedentary environment it is increasingly achieved through weight gain. Matching energy intake to",

    "Health benefits of nut consumption with special reference to body weight control.\tNuts are an integral part of the Mediterranean food patterns, and their incorporation into the regular diets of human beings is believed to provide many health benefits. The recent recognition of nuts as \"heart-healthy\" foods by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given a major boost to the positive image of nuts. Nut consumption has been associated with several health benefits, such as antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, cardioprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic benefits, among other functional properties. However, although nuts possess these many health benefits, their consumption has been hampered by a lack of adequate information"
