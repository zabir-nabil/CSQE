    "Autophagy, the process by which cells remove damaged or unnecessary components, has been a topic of increasing interest in longevity research. By triggering autophagy, it is believed that cells can more efficiently clean themselves up, leading to a potential increase in lifespan. Through various studies, scientists have explored ways to exploit autophagy mechanisms to promote longevity. Strategies like caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and certain dietary interventions have shown to activate autophagy pathways in cells, which could potentially contribute to a longer and healthier life. However, it is important to note that further research is still needed to fully understand the intricacies of autophagy and its role in longevity. In the meantime, adopting healthy lifestyle practices and staying informed on the latest advancements in autophagy research may offer potential benefits for those seeking to live longer.",
    "Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the recycling of damaged organelles and proteins within the cell, helping to maintain cellular health and functionality. Research has suggested that harnessing the power of autophagy could potentially lead to increased longevity and improved overall health. By promoting autophagy through methods such as fasting, exercise, and certain dietary interventions, individuals may be able to support their cells in clearing out harmful waste and improving cellular function. With further research and understanding of how to manipulate autophagy effectively, there is exciting potential to leverage this process to help individuals live longer, healthier lives."

    "Exploiting Autophagy to Live Longer Licorice and licochalcone-A induce autophagy in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by suppression of Bcl-2 expression and the mTOR pathway. This paper demonstrates for the first time that licorice Glycyrrhiza glabra and its component licochalcone-A (LA) can induce autophagy in addition to apoptosis in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. To adapt to their limitation during periods of protein starvation, multiple adaptive mechanisms have evolved, including a rapid cessation of new protein synthesis, an increase in amino acid biosynthesis and transport, and autophagy. Here, we discuss what we currently know about how amino acid limitation is sensed, and how this sensing might be transmitted to mTORC1 to regulate protein synthesis and autophagy. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human PCas. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of PCa. MTOC1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer.",

    "Licorice and licochalcone-A induce autophagy in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by suppression of Bcl-2 expression and the mTOR pathway.\tLicorice is a common Chinese medicinal herb with antitumor activity. Some components in licorice root have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cancer cells. This paper demonstrates for the first time that licorice Glycyrrhiza glabra and its component licochalcone-A (LA) can induce autophagy in addition to apoptosis in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Exposure of cells to licorice or LA resulted in several confirmed characteristics of autophagy, including the appearance of autophagic vacuoles revealed by monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining, formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), and autophagosome membrane",
    "Satiety: have we neglected dietary non-nutrients?\tSatiety, which is the inhibition of eating following the end of a meal, is influenced by a number of food characteristics, including compositional and structural factors. An increased understanding of these factors and the mechanisms whereby they exert their effects on satiety may offer a food-based approach to weight management. Water and gas, which are often neglected in nutrition, are major components of many foods and contribute to volume, and to sensory and other characteristics. A review of previous short-term studies that evaluated the effects of water or gas in foods on satiety showed that while satiety was generally increased, effects on subsequent",
    "Amino acid sensing and regulation of mTORC1.\tAmino acids play fundamental roles in the cell both as the building blocks of new proteins and as metabolic precursors. To adapt to their limitation during periods of protein starvation, multiple adaptive mechanisms have evolved, including a rapid cessation of new protein synthesis, an increase in amino acid biosynthesis and transport, and autophagy. Here, we discuss what we currently know about how amino acid limitation is sensed, and how this sensing might be transmitted to mTORC1 to regulate protein synthesis and autophagy.

    "Caloric restriction in humans: potential pitfalls and health concerns.\tTo date, the only intervention that has consistently been shown to slow the rate of aging, and to increase mean and maximum lifespan in short-lived species, is life-long calorie restriction. It is yet unclear whether long-term calorie restriction in longer lived species (i.e. primates and humans) will have a similar effect. In humans, several studies investigating short-term calorie restriction or \"weight loss\" programs suggest beneficial outcomes on parameters of cardiovascular disease. Studies on long-term calorie restriction are performed on a self-selected group of human subjects and show similar effects. However, few",

    "Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause mortality: a dose-response analysis.\tBACKGROUND: The association between fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and overall mortality has seldom been investigated in large cohort studies. Findings from the few available studies are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the dose-response relation between FV consumption and mortality, in terms of both time and rate, in a large prospective cohort of Swedish men and women. DESIGN: FV consumption was assessed through a self-administrated questionnaire in a population-based cohort of 71,706 participants (38,221 men and 33,485 women) aged 45-83 y. We performed a dose-response analysis to",
    "Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Statistics of Oldest Old People (>80 Years) Living in Ikaria Island: The Ikaria Study\tBackground. There are places around the world where people live longer and they are active past the age of 100 years, sharing common behavioral characteristics; these places (i.e., Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan, Loma Linda in California and Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica) have been named the \u201cBlue Zones\u201d. Recently it was reported that people in Ikaria Island, Greece, have also one of the highest life expectancies in the world, and joined the \u201cBlue Zones\u201d.

    "Long-term walnut supplementation without dietary advice induces favorable serum lipid changes in free-living individuals.\tBACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Walnuts have been shown to reduce serum lipids in short-term well-controlled feeding trials. Little information exists on the effect and sustainability of walnut consumption for longer duration in a free-living situation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A randomized crossover design in which 87 subjects with normal to moderate high plasma total cholesterol were initially assigned to a walnut-supplemented diet or habitual (control) diet for a 6-month period, then switched to the alternate dietary intervention for a second 6-month period. Each subject attended seven clinics 2 months apart",
    "The impact of cow's milk-mediated mTORC1-signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer\tProstate cancer (PCa) is dependent on androgen receptor signaling and aberrations of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway mediating excessive and sustained growth signaling. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human PCas. Oncogenic mTORC1 signaling activates key subsets of mRNAs that cooperate in distinct steps of PCa initiation and progression. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of PCa. mTORC1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer.",
    "Flavanols, the Kuna, Cocoa Consumption, and Nitric Oxide\tThe Kuna Indians who reside in an archipelago on the Caribbean Coast of Panama have very low blood pressure levels, live longer than other Panamanians, and have a reduced frequency of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and cancer -- at least on their death certificates. One outstanding feature of their diet includes a very high intake of flavanol-rich cocoa. Flavonoids in cocoa activate nitric oxide synthesis in healthy humans. The possibility that the high flavanol intake protects the Kuna against high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and cancer is sufficiently intriguing and sufficiently important that large, randomized controlled"
