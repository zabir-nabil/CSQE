    "The Atkins diet is a popular low-carb eating plan that focuses on limiting the consumption of carbohydrates to promote weight loss and improve overall health. Developed by Dr. Robert Atkins, this diet encourages a high intake of protein and fat while restricting the intake of carbohydrates like bread, pasta, and sugar. The theory behind the Atkins diet is that by reducing carb intake, the body is forced to burn stored fat for energy instead of relying on carbs for fuel. This process, known as ketosis, can lead to rapid weight loss and improved energy levels. However, some critics argue that the Atkins diet may not be sustainable in the long term and could potentially lead to nutritional deficiencies if followed incorrectly. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider or nutritionist before starting any new diet plan to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your individual needs.",
    "The Atkins diet is a low-carbohydrate eating plan that focuses on consuming high amounts of protein and healthy fats while limiting the intake of carbohydrates. The main principle behind the Atkins diet is that by reducing carb intake, the body is encouraged to burn stored fat as a primary source of energy, leading to weight loss. The diet is typically divided into four phases: induction, balancing, fine-tuning, and maintenance. During the induction phase, carbohydrate intake is limited to jumpstart weight loss, while in later phases, carbs are gradually reintroduced while still controlling portion sizes. It is important to note that the Atkins diet may not be suitable for everyone, and consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any diet is recommended."

    "Atkins diet, The Atkins Diet is low in carbohydrate and usually high in fat; the Japanese diet is high in carbohydrate and usually low in fat. One commonality of both diets is that they both eliminate the monosaccharide fructose. We determined the effect of a low-carb diet and restricted feeding (70% ad libitum intake) on serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, ketone bodies, and insulin in rats. Our objective was to determine the effect on weight loss and LDL-C concentration of a low-carbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins from gluten, soy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and vegetable oils. To date, no study has addressed whether a diet specifically lowering fructose but not total carbohydrates can reduce features of metabolic syndrome.",

    "Fructose: It\u2019s \u201cAlcohol Without the Buzz\u201d\tWhat do the Atkins Diet and the traditional Japanese diet have in common? The Atkins Diet is low in carbohydrate and usually high in fat; the Japanese diet is high in carbohydrate and usually low in fat. Yet both work to promote weight loss. One commonality of both diets is that they both eliminate the monosaccharide fructose. Sucrose (table sugar) and its synthetic sister high fructose corn syrup consist of 2 molecules, glucose and fructose. Glucose is the molecule that when polymerized forms starch, which has a high glycemic index, generates an insulin response, and is not particularly sweet. Fructose is found in fruit",
    "Effects of very-low-carbohydrate (horsemeat- or beef-based) diets and restricted feeding on weight gain, feed and energy efficiency, as well as ser...\tBACKGROUND/AIMS: The beneficial or harmful effect of the low-carbohydrate (low-carb), high-protein, high-fat diet (Atkins diet) has not been clearly demonstrated. We determined the effect of a low-carb diet and restricted feeding (70% ad libitum intake) on serum levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, ketone bodies and insulin in rats. METHODS: In experiment 1, each of 4 groups with 10 adult rats was assigned to a high-",
    "The effect of a plant-based low-carbohydrate (\"Eco-Atkins\") diet on body weight and blood lipid concentrations in hyperlipidemic subjects.\tBACKGROUND: Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. The effect of exchanging the animal proteins and fats for those of vegetable origin has not been tested. Our objective was to determine the effect on weight loss and LDL-C concentration of a low-carbohydrate diet high in vegetable proteins from gluten, soy, nuts, fruits, vegetables, cereals, and vegetable oils",
    "Vegetarian diet for patients with rheumatoid arthritis--status: two years after introduction of the diet.\tWe have previously reported that a significant improvement can be obtained in rheumatoid arthritis patients by fasting followed by an individually adjusted vegetarian diet for one year. The patients who changed their diet could be divided into diet responders and diet nonresponders. After the clinical trial the patients were free to change diet or medication and after approximately one year they were asked to attend a new clinical examination. We compared the change from baseline (i.e. at the time of study entry) to the time of the follow-up examination for diet responders, diet nonresponders and controls who ate an omnivorous diet",
    "Mediterranean and low-fat diets improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men.\tBACKGROUND: The regulatory function of the endothelium is altered in hypercholesterolemia, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients is affected by replacing a saturated fat-enriched diet with a low-fat, low-saturated fat diet (the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program stage 1 [NCEP-1] diet) or a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (such as that common in Mediterranean countries). DESIGN: Intervention dietary study with a baseline phase and two randomized crossover dietary periods. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Reina Sof\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba",
    "Effects of increased dietary protein-to-carbohydrate ratios in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\tBACKGROUND: Some evidence has suggested that a diet with a higher ratio of protein to carbohydrates has metabolic advantages in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of a high-protein (HP) diet to a standard-protein (SP) diet in women with PCOS. DESIGN: A controlled, 6-mo trial was conducted in 57 PCOS women. The women were assigned through rank minimization to one of the following 2 diets without caloric restriction: an HP diet (>40% of energy from",
    "The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome param...\tOne of the proposed causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome is the excessive intake of products containing added sugars, in particular, fructose. Although the ability of excessive intake of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome is mounting, to date, no study has addressed whether a diet specifically lowering fructose but not total carbohydrates can reduce features of metabolic syndrome. A total of 131 patients were randomized to compare the short-term effects of 2 energy-restricted diets-a low-fructose diet vs a moderate natural fructose diet-on",
    "A legume-based hypocaloric diet reduces proinflammatory status and improves metabolic features in overweight/obese subjects.\tBACKGROUND: The nutritional composition of the dietary intake could produce specific effects on metabolic variables and inflammatory marker concentrations. This study assessed the effects of two hypocaloric diets (legume-restricted- vs. legume-based diet) on metabolic and inflammatory changes, accompanying weight loss. METHODS: Thirty obese subjects (17 M/13F; BMI: 32.5 \u00b1 4.5 kg/m(2); 36 \u00b1 8 years) were randomly assigned to one of the following hypocaloric treatments (8 weeks): Calorie-restricted legume-free diet (Control: C-diet) or calorie-restricted legume-",
    "A low-fat vegan diet and a conventional diabetes diet in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled, 74-wk clinical trial\tBackground: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardiovascular health. Objective: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight, and plasma lipids. Design: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n = 49) or a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n = 50) for 74 wk.

    "Chronic effects of a high-fat diet enriched with virgin olive oil and a low-fat diet enriched with alpha-linolenic acid on postprandial endothelial...\tTraditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with endothelial dysfunction. The vascular endothelium plays a key role in local vascular tone regulation and can be modulated by dietary fat. We propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), all fractions"
