Mercury exposure and risks from dental amalgam in the US population, post-2000. This paper aims to provide dental health professionals with practical advice to pass on to patients about diet and dental health. Different foods carry different dental health risks; those containing non-milk, extrinsic sugars are potentially the most damaging. To review recent literature on important topics in pediatric office practice: bullying, screening for the prediabetic state, and pediatric oral health. Recent literature shows that bullying behaviors are common in children as young as kindergarten age, that there is a strong association between being a bully or victim and a range of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms in children. Dental amalgam is 50% metallic mercury (Hg) by weight and Hg vapor continuously evolves from in-place dental amalgam, causing increased Hg content with increasing amalgam load in urine, feces, exhaled breath, saliva, blood, and various organs and tissues including the kidney, pituitary gland, liver, and brain."

    "Mercury exposure and risks from dental amalgam in the US population, post-2000.\tDental amalgam is 50% metallic mercury (Hg) by weight and Hg vapour continuously evolves from in-place dental amalgam, causing increased Hg content with increasing amalgam load in urine, faeces, exhaled breath, saliva, blood, and various organs and tissues including the kidney, pituitary gland, liver, and brain. The Hg content also increases with maternal amalgam load in amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, meconium, various foetal tissues including liver, kidney and brain, in colostrum and breast milk. Based on 2001 to 2004 population statistics, 181.1 million Americans carry a grand total of",
    "High-fiber foods reduce periodontal disease progression in men aged 65 and older: the Veterans Affairs normative aging study/Dental Longitudinal St...\tOBJECTIVES: To determine whether foods that are good to excellent sources of fiber reduce periodontal disease progression in men. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Greater Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred twenty-five community-dwelling men participating in the Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study. MEASUREMENTS: Dental and physical examinations were conducted every 3 to 5 years. Diet was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Mean follow-up was 15 years (range: 2-24 years).",
    "Diet, nutrition and the prevention of dental diseases.\tOral health is related to diet in many ways, for example, nutritional influences on craniofacial development, oral cancer and oral infectious diseases. Dental diseases impact considerably on self-esteem and quality of life and are expensive to treat. The objective of this paper is to review the evidence for an association between nutrition, diet and dental diseases and to present dietary recommendations for their prevention. Nutrition affects the teeth during development and malnutrition may exacerbate periodontal and oral infectious diseases. However, the most significant effect of nutrition on teeth is the local action of diet in the mouth on the development of dental caries and enamel erosion",
    "Influence of drinking patterns of carbonated beverages on dental erosion.\tAs a hard tissue dental disease, dental erosion has a multifactorial etiology. The majority of dental erosion that originates from extrinsic sources is the result of dietary intake, particularly acidic beverages. Several preventive means have been proposed to minimize the damage to the dentition, including a reduction in the consumption of causative beverages and the adoption of a specific method of drinking, utilizing a straw instead of a cup. This article presents two cases involving the clinical and radiographic features of erosion lesions associated with chronic and excessive intake of acidic carbonated beverages. These examples embody how drinking patterns influence the formation of erosion lesions in various anatomic",
    "Dental X-rays and Risk of Meningioma\tContext Ionizing radiation is a consistently identified and potentially modifiable risk factor for meningioma, the most frequently reported primary brain tumor in the United States. Objective To examine the association between dental x-rays, the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation, and risk of intra-cranial meningioma. Design and Setting Population-based case-control study design. Participants The study includes 1433 intra-cranial meningioma cases aged 29-79 years diagnosed among residents of the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area and eight Houston, Texas counties between May 1, 2006 and April 28, 2011 and 1350",
    "Dietary behavior and knowledge of dental erosion among Chinese adults\tObjectives To study the dietary behavior and knowledge about dental erosion and self-reported symptoms that can be related to dental erosion among Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Methods Chinese adults aged 25-45 years were randomly selected from a list of registered telephone numbers generated by computer. A telephone survey was administered to obtain information on demographic characteristics, dietary habits, dental visits, and knowledge of and presence of self-reported symptoms that can be related to dental erosion. Results A total of 520 participants were interviewed (response rate, 75%; sampling error, \u00b1 4.4%) and their mean age was 37.",
    "Is the consumption of fruit cariogenic?\tAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate possible risk factors for dental caries in primary school children. METHODS: Children aged 10-12 years (n = 257) residing in Lithgow, a non-fluoridated community in New South Wales, Australia, were examined for caries experience in the permanent dentition. Information on dental practices, diet, residential movements, and socioeconomic status were obtained from self-completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Caries risk in the permanent teeth was associated with social disadvantage and diet. Among the dietary factors, the frequency of fruit consumption was associated with higher odds of caries experience (odds ratio: 1.52",
    "Fish consumption, methylmercury and child neurodevelopment\tPurpose of review To summarize recent evidence regarding associations of early life exposure to mercury from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy, thimerosal in vaccines and dental amalgam with child neurodevelopment. Recent findings Recent publications have built upon previous evidence demonstrating mild detrimental neurocognitive effects from prenatal methylmercury exposure from maternal fish consumption during pregnancy. New studies examining the effects of prenatal fish consumption as well as methylmercury suggest there are benefits from prenatal fish consumption, but also that consumption of fish high in mercury should be avoided. Future studies incorporating information on both the methylmercury and the docosahexaenoic acid contained within fish will help to refine recommendations to optimize outcomes for mothers and children.",
    "Pediatrician's role in screening and treatment: bullying, prediabetes, oral health.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent literature on important topics in pediatric office practice: bullying, screening for the prediabetic state, and pediatric oral health. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature shows that bullying behaviors are common in children as young as kindergarten age, that there is a strong association between being a bully or victim and a range of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms in children, and that interventions including family therapy and school-based programs are effective for bullies and victims. Recent studies have further delineated glucose and insulin metabolism. Recent work has provided new models to help practitioners screen for the prediabetic",
    "Dietary advice in dental practice.\tThis paper aims to provide dental health professionals with practical advice to pass on to patients about diet and dental health. Sugars are the most important dietary factor contributing to dental caries. Different foods carry different dental health risks; those containing non-milk, extrinsic sugars are potentially the most damaging. In the UK, sugared soft drinks and confectionery contribute approximately 50% to total intake of non-milk extrinsic sugars. Patients should be encouraged to reduce the frequency of intake of sugary foods. Intake of acidic foods and drinks contributes to dental erosion and consumption of such foods should also be limited. Dietary advice to dental patients should be positive"
