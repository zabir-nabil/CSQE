    "Growth promoters are substances or compounds that enhance the growth and development of organisms. In agriculture, growth promoters are commonly used to increase the growth rate and improve the overall health of plants and animals. These promoters can stimulate cell division, increase nutrient absorption, and boost metabolism, leading to faster and more efficient growth.\n\nIn livestock farming, growth promoters are often antibiotics or hormones that are added to feed to help animals grow faster and produce more meat, milk, or eggs. However, there is growing concern about the long-term effects of these substances on human health and the environment, leading to calls for more sustainable and natural alternatives.\n\nIn plant agriculture, growth promoters can include fertilizers, plant hormones, and biostimulants that help plants reach their full potential by providing essential nutrients and promoting strong root development. By using growth promoters strategically, farmers can increase their crop yields, improve crop quality, and reduce the use of harmful chemicals.\n\nOverall, the use of growth promoters in agriculture can be beneficial for increasing productivity and sustainability, but it is important to consider the potential risks and seek out alternatives that are safe for both the environment and human health.",

    "growth promoters, Milk has been recognized to represent a functionally active nutrient system promoting neonatal growth of mammals. The review presents milk as a materno-neonatal relay system functioning by transfer of preferential amino acids, which increase plasma levels of various growth-promoting factors. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human prostate cancers. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of prostate cancer. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence, and adulthood. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen that induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Cows' milk stimulates the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture. The study found that cows' milk increased the growth rate of prostate cancer cells in experiments. In the livestock industry, hormonal growth promoters ('anabolics') are used to increase the production of muscle meat. There are international disputes about the safety of meat from animals treated with hormonal growth promoters.",

There is still a lack of information on the mechanisms of mTORC1 up-regulation by milk consumption.

    "The impact of cow's milk-mediated mTORC1-signaling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer\tProstate cancer (PCa) is dependent on androgen receptor signaling and aberrations of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway mediating excessive and sustained growth signaling. The nutrient-sensitive kinase mTORC1 is upregulated in nearly 100% of advanced human PCas. Oncogenic mTORC1 signaling activates key subsets of mRNAs that cooperate in distinct steps of PCa initiation and progression. Epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy protein consumption as a major dietary risk factor for the development of PCa. mTORC1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and autophagy pathways that couple nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer.",
    "Milk consumption: aggravating factor of acne and promoter of chronic diseases of Western societies.\tConsumption of cow's milk and cow's milk protein result in changes of the hormonal axis of insulin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) in humans. Milk consumption raises IGF-1 serum levels in the perinatal period, adolescence and adulthood. During puberty with the physiological onset of increased secretion of growth hormone, IGF-1 serum levels increase and are further enhanced by milk consumption. IGF-1 is a potent mitogen; after binding to its receptor in various tissues, it induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Keratinocytes and sebocytes, as well as the androgen-synthesizing adrenals and gonads, are",
    "Growth Hormone Receptor Deficiency is Associated With a Major Reduction in Pro-aging Signaling, Cancer and Diabetes in Humans\tLife span extending mutations in growth signaling pathways protect against age-dependent DNA damage in yeast and decrease insulin resistance and cancer in mice. To test their effect in humans, we monitored for 22 years Ecuadorian subjects with mutations in the growth hormone receptor gene leading to severe growth hormone receptor (GHR) and IGF-I deficiencies and combined this information with surveys to identify the cause and age of death for subjects who died before this period. The individuals with GHR deficiency (GHRD) exhibited only one non-lethal malignancy and no cases of diabetes, in",
    "Milk stimulates growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.\tConcern has been expressed about the fact that cows' milk contains estrogens and could stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors. In this study, organic cows' milk and two commercial substitutes were digested in vitro and tested for their effects on the growth of cultures of prostate and breast cancer cells. Cows' milk stimulated the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in each of 14 separate experiments, producing an average increase in growth rate of over 30%. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of these cells by over 30%. Neither cows' milk nor almond milk affected the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer",
    "Leucine signaling in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity\tEpidemiological evidence points to increased dairy and meat consumption, staples of the Western diet, as major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This paper presents a new concept and comprehensive review of leucine-mediated cell signaling explaining the pathogenesis of T2D and obesity by leucine-induced over-stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1, a pivotal nutrient-sensitive kinase, promotes growth and cell proliferation in response to glucose, energy, growth factors and amino acids. Dairy proteins and meat stimulate insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and provide high amounts",
    "Potential role of FoxO1 and mTORC1 in the pathogenesis of Western diet-induced acne\tAcne in adolescents of developed countries is an epidemic skin disease and has currently been linked to the Western diet (WD). It is the intention of this viewpoint to discuss the possible impact of WD-mediated nutrient signalling in the pathogenesis of acne. High glycaemic load and dairy protein consumption both increase insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signalling (IIS) that is superimposed on elevated IGF-1 signalling of puberty. The cell's nutritional status is primarily sensed by the forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FoxO1) and the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (",
    "Hormonal growth promoting agents in food producing animals.\tIn contrast to the use of hormonal doping agents in sports to enhance the performance of athletes, in the livestock industry hormonal growth promoters (\"anabolics\") are used to increase the production of muscle meat. This leads to international disputes about the safety of meat originating from animals treated with such anabolics.As a consequence of the total ban in the EU of all hormonal active growth promoters (\"hormones\") in livestock production, in contrast to their legal use [e.g. of five such hormones (17beta-estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, trenbolone and zeranol) as small solid ear implants and two hormones as feed",
    "Possible health impact of animal oestrogens in food.\tOestrogens govern reproductive functions in vertebrates, and are present in all animal tissues. The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) of oestradiol-17beta by consumption of cattle meat is calculated to be 4.3 ng. Following the use of oestradiol-containing growth-promoting agents, TMDI is increased by a factor of 4.6 to 20 ng oestradiol-17beta, assuming that single dosage and 'good animal husbandry' are observed. Pork and poultry probably contain similar amounts of oestrogens as untreated cattle. The mean concentration of oestradiol-17beta in whole milk is estimated at 6.4 pg/ml. Scarce data available on eggs report up to 200 pg/g oestradiol-17beta."
