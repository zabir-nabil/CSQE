    "A coma is a profound state of unconsciousness where an individual is unable to be awakened and does not display any meaningful responses to their environment. This altered state of consciousness can be caused by various factors, such as severe head trauma, a stroke, or a medical condition affecting the brain. During a coma, the brain's activity is significantly reduced, leading to a lack of awareness of one's surroundings and an inability to interact with the external world. Comas can vary in duration and severity, with some individuals emerging from the state relatively quickly, while others may remain in a coma for an extended period of time. The medical treatment and prognosis for individuals in a coma depend on the underlying cause and the extent of brain injury sustained. It is crucial for medical professionals to carefully monitor and manage individuals in a coma to optimize their chances of recovery and minimize potential complications.",
    "A coma is a state of prolonged unconsciousness in which an individual is unresponsive to their environment and unable to wake up. It can be caused by various medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, or infections. During a coma, the brain is in a state of minimal activity, and the individual is unable to communicate or respond to stimuli. Comas can vary in severity and duration, with some individuals emerging from a coma relatively quickly, while others may remain in a coma for an extended period of time. Treatment and prognosis for comas depend on the underlying cause and the individual's overall health. It is essential for medical professionals to closely monitor comatose patients and provide supportive care to optimize their chances of recovery."

    "Amnesic shellfish poison.\tAmnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is caused by consumption of shellfish that have accumulated domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by some strains of phytoplankton. The neurotoxic properties of domoic acid result in neuronal degeneration and necrosis in specific regions of the hippocampus. A serious outbreak of ASP occurred in Canada in 1987 and involved 150 reported cases, 19 hospitalisations and 4 deaths after consumption of contaminated mussels. Symptoms ranged from gastrointestinal disturbances, to neurotoxic effects such as hallucinations, memory loss and coma. Monitoring programmes are in place in numerous countries worldwide and closures of shellfish harvesting areas occur when domoic acid concentrations exceed regulatory limits. This paper reviews the chemistry, sources,",
    "Hydrogen peroxide poisoning.\tHydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent that is used in a number of household products, including general-purpose disinfectants, chlorine-free bleaches, fabric stain removers, contact lens disinfectants and hair dyes, and it is a component of some tooth whitening products. In industry, the principal use of hydrogen peroxide is as a bleaching agent in the manufacture of paper and pulp. Hydrogen peroxide has been employed medicinally for wound irrigation and for the sterilisation of ophthalmic and endoscopic instruments. Hydrogen peroxide causes toxicity via three main mechanisms: corrosive damage, oxygen gas formation and lipid peroxidation. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is caustic and exposure may result in local tissue damage.",
    "Bitter melon (Momordica charantia): a review of efficacy and safety.\tThe pharmacology, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and place in therapy of bitter melon are described. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is an alternative therapy that has primarily been used for lowering blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. Components of bitter melon extract appear to have structural similarities to animal insulin. Antiviral and antineoplastic activities have also been reported in vitro. Four clinical trials found bitter melon juice, fruit, and dried powder to have a moderate hypoglycemic effect. These studies were small and were not randomized or double-blind, however. Reported adverse effects of bitter melon",
    "Domoic acid and human exposure risks: a review.\tDomoic acid is a potent neurotoxin that is naturally produced by several diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. The toxin acts as a glutamate agonist and is excitotoxic in the vertebrate central nervous system and other glutamate receptor-rich organs. Human exposure to domoic acid occurs via the consumption of contaminated shellfish that have accumulated the toxin while filter feeding on toxigenic phytoplankton during blooms. The first reported human domoic acid poisoning event occurred in Canada in 1987 during which clinical signs of acute toxicity such as gastrointestinal distress, confusion, disorientation, memory loss, coma and death were observed. The illness was named amnesic shellfish poisoning (",
    "Ciguatera: recent advances but the risk remains.\tCiguatera is an important form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of seafood. The disease is characterised by gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances. In cases of severe toxicity, paralysis, coma and death may occur. There is no immunity, and the toxins are cumulative. Symptoms may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. The epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resources. Ciguatera is an important medical entity in tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and in the tropical Caribbean. As reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas, it has"
