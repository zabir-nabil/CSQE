    "Caffeinated tea has been a topic of debate when it comes to its hydration properties. While caffeine is a diuretic that can cause increased urine production, leading some to believe that caffeinated tea may be dehydrating, research suggests that the hydrating effects of tea may outweigh the diuretic effects of caffeine. The water content of tea, along with its electrolytes and antioxidants, can contribute to overall hydration. Additionally, moderate consumption of caffeinated tea is unlikely to lead to significant fluid loss that would result in dehydration. However, excessive consumption of caffeinated tea, just like any other beverage containing caffeine, may lead to dehydration. It is important to listen to your body's signals and balance your intake of caffeinated tea with other hydrating beverages to maintain optimal hydration levels.",
    "Caffeinated tea has long been associated with dehydration due to its diuretic properties. While caffeine is known to increase urine output, leading to fluid loss, research suggests that caffeinated tea may not have as significant of a dehydrating effect as once believed. Recent studies have found that moderate consumption of caffeinated tea may not lead to dehydration, as the fluid intake from tea can still contribute to overall hydration. However, excessive consumption of caffeinated tea, especially in place of water, can potentially lead to dehydration. It is recommended to balance caffeinated tea intake with adequate water consumption to maintain proper hydration levels."

    "Is Caffeinated Tea Really Dehydrating? Black tea is not significantly different from water in the maintenance of normal hydration in human subjects. There is a belief that caffeinated drinks, such as tea, may adversely affect hydration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of black tea on coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). Epidemiologic studies suggest that tea consumption decreases the risk for cardiovascular events. This article highlights the implications of caffeine intake in pregnancy, reviews the latest evidence-based information available. Reproductive-aged and pregnant women are 'at risk' subgroups of the population who may require specific advice on moderating their daily caffeine intake.",

    "Effect of decaffeination of coffee or tea on gastro-oesophageal reflux.\tBACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are believed to cause gastro-oesophageal reflux; however, the effects of these beverages and of their major component, caffeine, have not been quantified. The aim of this study was to evaluate gastro-oesophageal reflux induced by coffee and tea before and after a decaffeination process, and to compare it with water and water-containing caffeine. METHODS: Three-hour ambulatory pH-metry was performed on 16 healthy volunteers, who received 300 ml of (i) regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee or tap water (n = 16), (ii) normal tea,",
    "The acute effect of green tea consumption on endothelial function in healthy individuals.\tBACKGROUND: Tea consumption is associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery is related to coronary endothelial function and it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. Black tea has a beneficial effect on endothelial function; the effect, however, of green tea on brachial artery reactivity has not been defined yet. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 14 healthy individuals (age 30+/-3 years) with no cardiovascular risk factors except from smoking (50%) on three separate occasions on which they took: (a) 6 g of green tea, (b)",
    "Intake of Japanese and Chinese teas reduces risk of Parkinson's disease.\tStudies that have addressed the association between the intake of coffee or caffeine and Parkinson's disease (PD) were conducted mainly in Western countries. Little is known about this relationship in an Asian population. Therefore, we performed an assessment of the association of the intake of coffee, other caffeine-containing beverages, and caffeine with the risk of PD in Japan. The study involved 249 PD cases and 368 control subjects. Information on dietary factors was obtained through a self-administered diet history questionnaire. Adjustment was made for sex, age, region of residence, educational level, pack-years of",
    "Black tea is not significantly different from water in the maintenance of normal hydration in human subjects: results from a randomised controlled ...\tThere is a belief that caffeinated drinks, such as tea, may adversely affect hydration. This was investigated in a randomised controlled trial. Healthy resting males (n 21) were recruited from the general population. Following 24 h of abstention from caffeine, alcohol and vigorous physical activity, including a 10 h overnight fast, all men underwent four separate test days in a counter-balanced order with a 5 d washout in between. The test beverages, provided at regular intervals, were 4 \u00d7 240 ml black (i.e. regular) tea and",
    "Black tea increases coronary flow velocity reserve in healthy male subjects.\tEpidemiologic studies suggest that tea consumption decreases the risk for cardiovascular events. However, there has been no clinical report examining the effects of tea consumption on coronary circulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of black tea on coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). This was a double-blind crossover study of 10 healthy male volunteers conducted to compare the effects of black tea and caffeine on coronary circulation. The coronary flow velocity of the left anterior descending coronary artery was measured at baseline and at hyperemia during adenosine triphosphate infusion by TTDE to determine CFVR.",
    "Evaluation of the cyto- and genotoxic activity of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) in human lymphocytes in vitro.\tDespite its antioxidant capacity and well-known health benefits, yerba mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) has been shown to possess some genotoxic and mutagenic activities and to increase incidence of some types of cancer. The aim of this study was to estimate the cyto- and genotoxicity of mate tea in human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro. We found that yerba mate extract induced a concentration-dependent, statistically significant increase in the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells and a decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI). Mate-exposed lymphocytes had a reduced transcriptional rDNA activity, which",
    "Caffeine in pregnancy.\tCaffeine is probably the most frequently ingested pharmacologically active substance in the world. It is found in common beverages (coffee, tea, soft drinks), in products containing cocoa or chocolate, and in medications. Because of its wide consumption at different levels by most segments of the population, the public and the scientific community have expressed interest in the potential for caffeine to produce adverse effects on human health. Reproductive-aged and pregnant women are 'at risk' subgroups of the population who may require specific advice on moderating their daily caffeine intake. This article highlights the implications of caffeine intake in pregnancy, reviews the latest evidence-based information available",
    "Effects of acute administration of caffeine on vascular function.\tCaffeine is the most widely used pharmacologic substance in the world. It is found in common nonessential grocery items (e.g., coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate). The effects of caffeine on cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, remain controversial, and there is little information on its direct effect on vascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of caffeine on endothelial function in humans. This study was a double-blind, randomized placebo and active drug study. Forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine (ACh), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and to sodium nitroprusside,",
