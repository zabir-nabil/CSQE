    "Cholesterol is a type of fat that is essential for building healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol in the blood can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease and stroke. Lower back pain, on the other hand, is a common condition that can have various causes, including injury, poor posture, and underlying health issues.\n\nWhile there is no direct connection between high cholesterol levels and lower back pain, maintaining healthy cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medication can help prevent cardiovascular problems that may indirectly contribute to back pain. Additionally, living a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and proper posture, can help reduce the risk of developing back pain and other health issues.\n\nIt is important to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice and treatment options for both high cholesterol and lower back pain to ensure overall well-being and quality of life.",
    "Cholesterol and lower back pain are not directly related, but there can be some indirect connections between them. High cholesterol levels, which can lead to a buildup of plaque in the arteries, may affect blood flow to the lower back region, potentially contributing to conditions like lower back pain. Additionally, some studies suggest that high cholesterol levels could be associated with increased inflammation in the body, which may exacerbate symptoms of conditions such as sciatica or arthritis, leading to lower back pain. Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and medication prescribed by a healthcare provider can help reduce the risk of potential complications that may contribute to lower back pain. If you are experiencing persistent lower back pain, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options."

    "MR aortography and serum cholesterol levels in patients with long-term nonspecific lower back pain.\tSTUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine and cholesterol levels on patients with long-term nonspecific lower back pain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether occlusion of lumbar and middle sacral arteries or serum cholesterol levels are associated with lower back pain and/or with disc degeneration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Atherosclerosis in the wall of the abdominal aorta usually develops at the ostia of branching arteries and the bifurcation, and may obliterate orifices of lumbar and middle sacral arteries. Obstruction of these arteries causes ischemia in the lumbar spine and may result in back symptoms and",
    "Atherosclerosis and disc degeneration/low-back pain--a systematic review.\tOBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis can obstruct branching arteries of the abdominal aorta, including four paired lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery that feed the lumbar spine. The diminished blood flow could result in various back problems. The aim of this systematic literature review was to assess associations between atherosclerosis and disc degeneration (DD) or low-back pain (LBP). DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the Medline/PubMed database for all original articles on atherosclerosis and DD/LBP published until October 2008. The search was performed with the medical subject headings atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk factor, or vascular disease and",
    "Non-specific low back pain.\tNon-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11-12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect",

A postmortem angiographic study on 140\u00a0subjects\tOBJECTIVES\u2014To study the prevalence of arterial diseases in the arteries supplying the lumbar spine and their relation to other vascular diseases, as well as to chronic low back pain. METHODS\u2014Five pairs of the lumbar arteries and the middle sacral artery were evaluated from 140\u00a0postmortem aortograms, performed in connection with routine medicolegal necropsies on subjects ranging from 16\u00a0to 89\u00a0years of age. For information about low back pain history, a close relative of each of the deceased was interviewed two to four weeks after the necropsy. RESULTS\u2014Twenty one (22%)",
    "Prevalence of low back pain in children and adolescents: a meta-analysis\tBackground Low back pain (LBP) is common in children and adolescents, and it is becoming a public health concern. In recent years there has been a considerable increase in research studies that examine the prevalence of LBP in this population, but studies exhibit great variability in the prevalence rates reported. The purpose of this research was to examine, by means of a meta-analytic investigation, the prevalence rates of LBP in children and adolescents. Methods Studies were located from computerized databases (ISI Web of Knowledge, MedLine, PEDro, IME, LILACS, and CINAHL) and other sources. The",
    "Degeneration of the intervertebral disc\tThe intervertebral disc is a cartilaginous structure that resembles articular cartilage in its biochemistry, but morphologically it is clearly different. It shows degenerative and ageing changes earlier than does any other connective tissue in the body. It is believed to be important clinically because there is an association of disc degeneration with back pain. Current treatments are predominantly conservative or, less commonly, surgical; in many cases there is no clear diagnosis and therapy is considered inadequate. New developments, such as genetic and biological approaches, may allow better diagnosis and treatments in the future.",
    "The Alkaline Diet: Is There Evidence That an Alkaline pH Diet Benefits Health?\tThis review looks at the role of an alkaline diet in health. Pubmed was searched looking for articles on pH, potential renal acid loads, bone health, muscle, growth hormone, back pain, vitamin D and chemotherapy. Many books written in the lay literature on the alkaline diet were also reviewed and evaluated in light of the published medical literature. There may be some value in considering an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases and further studies are warranted in this area of medicine.",

    "Topical vitamin A treatment of recalcitrant common warts.\tBACKGROUND: Common warts (verruca vulgaris) are benign epithelial proliferations associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salicylic acid and cryotherapy are the most frequent treatments for common warts, but can be painful and cause scarring, and have high failure and recrudescence rates. Topical vitamin A has been shown to be a successful treatment of common warts in prior informal studies. CASE: The subject is a healthy, physically-active 30 old female with a 9 year history of common warts on the back of the right hand. The warts resisted treatment with salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar and an over-the-counter blend"
