    "Breast pain, also known as mastalgia, is a common complaint that many women experience at some point in their lives. There are different causes of breast pain, ranging from hormonal fluctuations to more serious conditions such as cysts or infections. Cyclical breast pain is often associated with the menstrual cycle and may be felt as a dull, heavy, or aching sensation in the breasts. Non-cyclical breast pain, on the other hand, can be caused by factors such as injury, medication side effects, or musculoskeletal issues.\n\nIf you are experiencing breast pain, it is important to pay attention to any accompanying symptoms, such as changes in breast size or texture, nipple discharge, or lumps. While most cases of breast pain are not a cause for concern, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare provider if you have persistent or severe pain, as they can help determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment options. In the meantime, wearing a well-fitting bra, reducing caffeine intake, and applying warm or cold compresses to the breasts may help alleviate discomfort. It's crucial to take care of your breast health and seek medical advice if needed.",
    "Breast pain, also known as mastalgia, can be a common occurrence in women. There are various reasons why someone may experience breast pain, including hormonal changes, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and certain medications. It is important to pay attention to the type and timing of the pain, as well as any other accompanying symptoms, to help determine the cause. In most cases, breast pain is not a cause for concern and can be managed with simple measures such as wearing a well-fitting bra, applying warm compresses, gentle massage, and over-the-counter pain relievers. However, if the pain is severe, persistent, accompanied by unusual changes in the breast, or if you have a family history of breast cancer, it is important to seek medical advice to rule out any underlying issues. Regular breast self-exams and mammograms are also crucial in maintaining breast health and detecting any potential problems early on."

    "breast pain A double blind trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease is reported. Bromocriptine produced a significant improvement in breast symptoms and a significant fall in prolactin levels in the cyclical pain group. Mastalgia affects up to two-thirds of women at some time during their reproductive lives. The majority of women can be reassured after a clinical evaluation. Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication.",

    "A double blind trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease.\tA double blind crossover trial of the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine in painful benign breast disease is reported. Twenty-nine women with cyclical mastalgia and 11 with non-cyclical pain were treated with bromocriptine, 5 mg daily, and placebo over six menstrual cycels. Assessment of response to treatment was made by a linear analogue system and clinical examination together with plasma prolactin estimations. Bromocriptine produced a significant improvement in breast symptoms and a significant fall in prolactin levels in the cyclical pain group, but had no effect in the non-cyclical group. These results suggest that bromocriptine offers a new and effective approach",
    "Mastalgia.\tOBJECTIVE: To review the current management of women with breast pain. OPTIONS: The effect of various treatment modes and health practices, including medications, was considered for the management of both cyclical and noncyclical breast pain. OUTCOMES: Effective and timely management of the woman with breast pain and improved quality of life. EVIDENCE: A literature search was performed to identify reports published in English between 1975 and July 2003 using MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. VALUES: Levels of evidence, as outlined, have been determined using the criteria outlined by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. Participants were the principal authors: a clinical dietitian, a surgeon",
    "Is there a role for surgery in the treatment of mastalgia?\tBreast pain is a common condition affecting most women at some stage in their reproductive life. Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication. The aims of this study were to audit the efficacy of surgery in severe treatment resistant mastalgia and to assess patient satisfaction following surgery. This is a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients seen in mastalgia clinic in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff since 1973. A postal questionnaire was distributed to all",
    "Mastalgia: a review of management.\tMastalgia affects up to two-thirds of women at some time during their reproductive lives. It is usually benign, but thefear of underlying breast cancer is why many women present for evaluation. Mastalgia can be associated with premenstrual syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease, psychologic disturbance and, rarely, breast cancer. Occasionally, extramammary conditions, like Tietzie syndrome, present as mastalgia. A thorough clinical evaluation is required to assess the cause. The majority of women can be reassured after a clinical evaluation. Approximately 15% require pain-relieving therapy.

Pulp\u2013Fortified Polyphenolic-Rich Fruit and Berry Juice Blend\tDietary interventions involving antioxidants are of interest for reducing inflammation, improving joint motion, and altering pain perception. We evaluated the effect of oral consumption of a fruit and berry blend on pain and range of motion (ROM). This open-label clinical pilot study involved 14 study participants with limitations in ROM that was associated with pain and affected daily living.

    "Repetitive rectal painful distention induces rectal hypersensitivity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\tBACKGROUND: A reduced rectal perceptual threshold has been reported in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but this phenomenon may be induced by a comorbid psychological state. We evaluated the rectal pain threshold at baseline and after conditioning (repetitive rectal painful distention: RRD) in patients with IBS or functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), which is an abdominal pain disorder, and in healthy controls, and determined whether rectal hypersensitivity is a reliable marker for IBS. METHODS: The rectal sensory threshold was assessed by a barostat. First, a ramp distention of 40 ml/min was induced,",
    "A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of acetaminophen for treatment of migraine headache.\tOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen 1000 mg for the treatment of episodic migraine headache. BACKGROUND: While acetaminophen is commonly used to treat migraine, there have been limited published clinical trial efficacy results. DESIGN/METHODS: Ten investigators at 13 private, ambulatory, primary care sites in the United States enrolled and treated 346 outpatient adults 18-72 years of age with migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of 6 hours duration. Each patient was randomly assigned to a single dose of study medication of acetaminophen",
    "Non-specific low back pain.\tNon-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11-12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect",
    "Treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome.\tFunctional abdominal pain in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a challenging problem for primary care physicians, gastroenterologists and pain specialists. We review the evidence for the current and future non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options targeting the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Cognitive interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy have demonstrated excellent results in IBS patients, but the limited availability and labor-intensive nature limit their routine use in daily practice. In patients who are refractory to first-line therapy, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are both effective to obtain symptomatic relief, but only",
    "Aspartame-induced fibromyalgia, an unusual but curable cause of chronic pain.\tWe report for the first time an unusual musculoskeletal adverse effect of aspartame in two patients. A 50-year-old woman had been suffering from widespread pain and fatigue for more than 10 years leading to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. During a vacation in a foreign country, she did not suffer from painful symptoms since she had forgotten to take her aspartame. All of the symptoms reappeared in the days following her return when she reintroduced aspartame into her daily diet. Thus, aspartame was definitively excluded from her diet, resulting in a complete regression of the fibromyalgia symptoms. A 43-year-"
