    "Insects are a diverse and fascinating group of animals that play vital roles in ecosystems around the world. With over one million described species, insects are incredibly diverse in terms of their shapes, sizes, colors, and behaviors. They can be found in nearly every habitat on Earth, from the densest rainforests to the driest deserts.\n\nInsects are key components of food chains, serving as both predators and prey. They also play important roles in pollination, helping to fertilize plants and ensure the production of fruits and seeds. Insects are crucial for the decomposition of organic matter, breaking down dead plants and animals to recycle nutrients back into the environment.\n\nWhile some insects are considered pests due to their effects on agriculture or human health, many species are beneficial to humans. For example, bees are essential pollinators for many crops, while ladybugs help control aphid populations in gardens.\n\nOverall, insects are an integral part of the natural world, contributing to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the overall health of our planet.",

    "insects Chitin is an eukaryotic extracellular aminosugar biopolymer, massively produced by most fungal systems and by invertebrates, notably arthropods. Chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide action. Many dietary phytochemicals that are synthesized as secondary metabolites function as toxins, that is, 'phytoalexins,' and hence protect plants against insects and other damaging organisms and stresses. Among the claims made for lavender oil are that is it antibacterial, antifungal, carminative (smooth muscle relaxing), sedative, antidepressive and effective for burns and insect bites. Tea leaves produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading pathogens including insects, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Polyphenolic compounds, the six so-called catechins, and the methyl-xanthine alkaloids caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline are involved in defense against insects. Clostridium difficile causes infectious diarrhea in humans and animals and has been found in both diarrheal and non-diarrheal pigs, horses, and cattle, suggesting a potential reservoir for human infection, and in 20-40% of meat products in Canada and the USA, suggesting the possibility, albeit not proven, of food-borne transmission.

    "Chitin synthesis and degradation as targets for pesticide action.\tVarious pesticides are being used to destabilize, perturb, or inhibit crucial biochemical and physiological targets related to metabolism, growth, development, nervous communication, or behavior in pestiferous organisms. Chitin is an eukaryotic extracellular aminosugar biopolymer, massively produced by most fungal systems and by invertebrates, notably arthropods. Being an integral supportive component in fungal cell wall, insect cuticle, and nematode egg shell, chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide action. Throughout the elaborate processes of chitin formation and deposition, only the polymerization events associated with the cell membrane compartment are so far available for chemical interference. Currently, the actinomycetes",
    "Insect food for astronauts: gas exchange in silkworms fed on mulberry and lettuce and the nutritional value of these insects for human consumption ...\tIn this study, silkworm moth (Bombyx mori L.) larvae were regarded as an animal protein source for astronauts in the bioregenerative life support system during long-term deep space exploration in the future. They were fed with mulberry and stem lettuce leaves during the first three instars and the last two instars, respectively. In addition, this kind of environmental approach, which utilised inedible biomass of plants to produce animal protein of high quality, can likewise be applied terrestrially to provide food for people living in extreme environments and/or impoverished agro-ecosystems",
    "Xenohormesis mechanisms underlying chemopreventive effects of some dietary phytochemicals.\tA wide variety of phytochemicals present in our diet, including fruits, vegetables, and spices, have been shown to possess a broad range of health-beneficial properties. The cytoprotective and restorative effects of dietary phytochemicals are likely to result from the modulation of several distinct cellular signal transduction pathways. Many dietary phytochemicals that are synthesized as secondary metabolites function as toxins, that is, \"phytoalexins,\" and hence protect plants against insects and other damaging organisms and stresses. However, at the relatively low doses consumed by humans and other mammals, these same toxic plant-derived chemicals, as mild stressors, activate adaptive cellular",
    "Biological activities of lavender essential oil.\tEssential oils distilled from members of the genus Lavandula have been used both cosmetically and therapeutically for centuries with the most commonly used species being L. angustifolia, L. latifolia, L. stoechas and L. x intermedia. Although there is considerable anecdotal information about the biological activity of these oils much of this has not been substantiated by scientific or clinical evidence. Among the claims made for lavender oil are that is it antibacterial, antifungal, carminative (smooth muscle relaxing), sedative, antidepressive and effective for burns and insect bites. In this review we detail the current state of knowledge about the effect of lavender oils on psychological and physiological parameters and its",
    "Overview of antibacterial, antitoxin, antiviral, and antifungal activities of tea flavonoids and teas.\tTea leaves produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading pathogens including insects, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These metabolites include polyphenolic compounds, the six so-called catechins, and the methyl-xanthine alkaloids caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Postharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases in green tea leaves prevents oxidation of the catechins, whereas postharvest enzyme-catalyzed oxidation (fermentation) of catechins in tea leaves results in the formation of four theaflavins as well as polymeric thearubigins. These substances impart the black color to black teas. Black and partly fermented",
    "Clostridium difficile infection in humans and piglets: a 'One Health' opportunity.\tClostridium difficile causes infectious diarrhoea in humans and animals. It has been found in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal pigs, horses and cattle, suggesting a potential reservoir for human insection, and in 20-40\u00a0% of meat products in Canada and the USA, suggesting the possibility, albeit not proven, of food-borne transmission. Although it is not yet completely clear, it is likely that excessive antimicrobial exposure is driving the establishment of C. difficile in animals, in a manner analogous to human infection, rather than the organism just being normal flora of the animal gastrointestinal tract.",
    "Fish and shellfish allergy in children: review of a persistent food allergy.\tThe increased consumption of fish and shellfish has resulted in more frequent reports of adverse reactions to seafood, emphasizing the need for more specific diagnosis and treatment of this condition and exploring reasons for the persistence of this allergy. This review discusses interesting and new findings in the area of fish and shellfish allergy. New allergens and important potential cross-reacting allergens have been identified within the fish family and between shellfish, arachnids, and insects. The diagnostic approach may require prick to-prick tests using crude extracts of both raw and cooked forms of seafood for screening seafood sensitization before a food challenge or where",
    "Multiple biological functions of sporamin related to stress tolerance in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam).\tThe initial investigation of the nature of the proteins in the tuber of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) revealed a globulin-designated \"ipomoein,\" which was reported by Jones and Gersdorff, (1931). Later, \"ipomoein\" was renamed \"sporamin\" and was found to be a major storage protein that accounted for over 80% of the total protein in the tuberous root. To date, sporamin has been studied by a series of biochemical and molecular approaches. The first purification of sporamin into two major fractions, A and B, was successfully completed"
