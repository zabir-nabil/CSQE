    "BMAA, short for Beta-methylamino-L-alanine, is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that has received increasing attention due to its potential link to neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and Alzheimer's. It is a naturally occurring compound produced by certain species of cyanobacteria, a type of blue-green algae found in freshwater and marine environments. BMAA can bioaccumulate in aquatic food chains, exposing humans and wildlife to potential health risks.\n\nStudies have shown that BMAA can mimic the amino acid L-serine, leading to its incorporation into proteins in place of serine. This can disrupt protein synthesis and function, potentially contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The exact mechanisms by which BMAA may cause harm are still being investigated, but research suggests that it may lead to the formation of protein aggregates in the brain, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.\n\nDue to the potential health risks associated with BMAA exposure, monitoring and regulating its presence in water sources and food supplies is important for public health. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of BMAA on human health and the environment, as well as to develop strategies for mitigating its impact.",
    "BMAA, which stands for beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, is a naturally occurring non-proteinogenic amino acid that has gained attention due to its potential association with various neurodegenerative diseases. Found in certain species of cyanobacteria, BMAA has been linked to the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanisms by which BMAA may contribute to these conditions and to explore potential prevention or treatment strategies.

    "BMAA The aim of this study was to screen for and quantify the neurotoxic amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in a cohort of autopsy specimens taken from Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and non-neurological controls. BMAA is produced by cyanobacteria found in a variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats.

Research on Guam suggested that ALS, Parkinson's disease and dementia (the ALS/PDC complex) was due to a neurotoxic non-protein amino acid, beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), in the seeds of the cycad Cycas micronesica. As root symbionts of cycad trees, cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc produce \u03b2-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid. We report that BMAA occurs not only as a free amino acid in the Guam ecosystem but also can be released from a bound form by acid hydrolysis. BMAA has been proposed to be the causative agent of devastating neurodegenerative diseases on the island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. Here we demonstrate, based on a recently developed extraction and HPLC-MS/MS method and long-term monitoring of BMAA in cyanobacterial populations of a temperate aquatic ecosystem (Baltic Sea, 2007\u20132008), that BMAA is biosynthesized by cyanobacterial genera dominating.

    "Beyond Guam: the cyanobacteria/BMAA hypothesis of the cause of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.\tExcitement about neurogenetics in the last two decades has diverted attention from environmental causes of sporadic ALS. Fifty years ago endemic foci of ALS with a frequency one hundred times that in the rest of the world attracted attention since they offered the possibility of finding the cause for non-endemic ALS throughout the world.

    "2-Amino-3-(methylamino)-propanoic acid (BMAA) in cycad flour: an unlikely cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia of Guam.\tWe conducted an investigation of the levels of the neurotoxin 2-amino-3-(methylamino)-propanoic acid (BMAA) in cycad flour. Analysis of 30 flour samples processed from the endosperm of Cycas circinalis seeds collected on Guam indicated that more than 87% of the total BMAA content was removed during processing. Furthermore, in 1/2 the samples almost all (greater than 99%) of the total BMAA was removed. We found no significant regional differences in the BMAA content of flour prepared from cycad seeds collected from several villages on Guam. Testing of different samples prepared",
    "A mechanism for slow release of biomagnified cyanobacterial neurotoxins and neurodegenerative disease in Guam\tAs root symbionts of cycad trees, cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc produce \u03b2-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid. The biomagnification of BMAA through the Guam ecosystem fits a classic triangle of increasing concentrations of toxic compounds up the food chain. However, because BMAA is polar and nonlipophilic, a mechanism for its biomagnification through increasing trophic levels has been unclear. We report that BMAA occurs not only as a free amino acid in the Guam ecosystem but also can be released from a bound form by acid hydrolysis. After first removing free amino acids from tissue samples",

    "Dietary BMAA Exposure in an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Cluster from Southern France\tBackground Dietary exposure to the cyanotoxin BMAA is suspected to be the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Western Pacific Islands. In Europe and North America, this toxin has been identified in the marine environment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clusters but, to date, only few dietary exposures have been described. Objectives We aimed at identifying cluster(s) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the H\u00e9rault district, a coastal district from Southern France, and to search, in the identified area(s), for the existence of a potential dietary source of BMAA. Methods A spatio-temporal cluster analysis was performed in the district, considering all",
    "Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin \u03b2-N-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in Shark Fins\tSharks are among the most threatened groups of marine species. Populations are declining globally to support the growing demand for shark fin soup. Sharks are known to bioaccumulate toxins that may pose health risks to consumers of shark products. The feeding habits of sharks are varied, including fish, mammals, crustaceans and plankton. The cyanobacterial neurotoxin \u03b2-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been detected in species of free-living marine cyanobacteria and may bioaccumulate in the marine food web. In this study, we sampled fin clips from seven different species of sharks in South",
    "Cyanobacterial Blooms and the Occurrence of the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in South Florida Aquatic Food Webs\tRecent studies demonstrate that most cyanobacteria produce the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and that it can biomagnify in at least one terrestrial food chain. BMAA has been implicated as a significant environmental risk in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We examined several blooms of cyanobacteria in South Florida, and the BMAA content of resident animals, including species used as human food. A wide range of BMAA concentrations were found,",
    "Synergistic toxicity of the environmental neurotoxins methylmercury and \u03b2-N-methylamino-L-alanine.\tDetermination of the environmental factors involved in neurodegenerative diseases has been elusive. Methylmercury and \u03b2-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) have both been implicated in this role. Exposure of primary cortical cultures to these compounds independently induced concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. Importantly, concentrations of BMAA (10-100 \u03bcM) that caused no toxicity alone potentiated methylmercury (3 \u03bcM) toxicity. In addition, concentrations of BMAA and methylmercury that had no effect by themselves on the main cellular antioxidant glutathione together decreased glutathione levels. Furthermore, the combined toxicity of methylmercury and BMAA was"
