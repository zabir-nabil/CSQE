Analysis showed that the contents of individual elements in herbs and infusions depended on the type of raw material, as well as on its origin.",
    "Immunity: plants as effective mediators.\tIn the domain of nutrition, exploring the diet-health linkages is major area of research. The outcomes of such interventions led to widespread acceptance of functional and nutraceutical foods; however, augmenting immunity is a major concern of dietary regimens. Indeed, the immune system is incredible arrangement of specific organs and cells that enabled humans to carry out defense against undesired responses. Its proper functionality is essential to maintain the body homeostasis. Array of plants and their components hold immunomodulating properties. Their possible inclusion in diets could explore new therapeutic avenues to enhanced immunity against diseases. The review intended to highlight the importance of garlic (Allium sativum),",
    "Variations in product choices of frequently purchased herbs: caveat emptor.\tBACKGROUND: Patients who report use of herbs to their physicians may not be able to accurately describe the ingredients or recommended dosage because the products for the same herb may differ. The purpose of this study was to describe variations in label information of products for each of the 10 most commonly purchased herbs. METHODS: Products for each of 10 herbs were surveyed in a convenience sample of 20 retail stores in a large metropolitan area.

    "The effects of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) on hypertension in patients with type II diabetes.\tTo compare the antihypertensive effectiveness of sour tea (ST; Hibiscus sabdariffa) with black tea (BT) infusion in diabetic patients, this double-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out. Sixty diabetic patients with mild hypertension, without taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidaemic medicines, were recruited in the study. The patients were randomly allocated to the ST and BT groups and instructed to drink ST and BT infusions two times a day for 1 month. Their blood pressure (BP) was measured on days 0, 15 and 30 of the study. The mean of systolic BP (SBP",
    "Effects of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) on lipid profile and lipoproteins in patients with type II diabetes.\tOBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that intake of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects and may benefit patients suffering from metabolic disorders such as diabetes. The objective of the present study was to investigate the hypolipidemic effects of sour tea in patients with diabetes and compare them with those of black tea. DESIGN: In this sequential randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients with diabetes were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: sour tea (ST) and black tea (BT).

    "Characterization of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg isolated from food animals, retail meat, and h...\tSalmonella enterica is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States. Although salmonellosis is usually self-limiting, severe infections typically require antimicrobial treatment, and ceftriaxone, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC), is commonly used in both adults and children. Surveillance conducted by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has shown a recent increase in ESC resistance among Salmonella Heidelberg isolated from food animals at slaughter, retail meat, and humans. ESC resistance among Salmonella in the United States is usually mediated by a plasmid-",
    "Morphine levels in urine subsequent to poppy seed consumption.\tUrine morphine levels after the consumption of poppy seeds were measured in two separate trials. Maximum levels of approximately 18 micrograms/ml were found using RIA, EMIT-ST and GC methodologies. Positive immunoassay results were seen up to 60 h post-ingestion. Several different lots of seeds from various sources were assayed for morphine and found to range from 4-200 mg/kg. Differentiation of poppy seed eaters from opiate users was not possible via the identification of minor alkaloid constituents of poppy seeds. It is, however, possible to analyse opiate urines with respect to 6-O-acetylmorphine. Below the level",
    "Physical exercise intervention in depressive disorders: meta-analysis and systematic review.\tPrevious meta-analyses investigating the effect of exercise on depression have included trials where the control condition has been categorized as placebo despite the fact that this particular placebo intervention (e.g., meditation, relaxation) has been recognized as having an antidepressant effect. Because meditation and mindfulness-based interventions are associated with depression reduction, it is impossible to separate the effect of the physical exercise from the meditation-related parts. The present study determined the efficacy of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression compared with no treatment, placebo conditions or usual care among clinically defined depressed adults.
