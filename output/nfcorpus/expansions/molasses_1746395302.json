    "Molasses is a thick, dark syrup that is produced during the process of refining sugar cane or sugar beets into sugar. It is a byproduct of this process and is known for its rich, bittersweet flavor. Molasses is often used as a sweetener in baking and cooking, adding depth and complexity to dishes. It is also a key ingredient in traditional recipes such as gingerbread cookies, barbecue sauce, and baked beans. With its distinctive taste and versatility in the kitchen, molasses is a beloved ingredient for adding flavor to a wide range of dishes.",

    "Total antioxidant content of alternatives to refined sugar.\tBACKGROUND: Oxidative damage is implicated in the etiology of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other degenerative disorders. Recent nutritional research has focused on the antioxidant potential of foods, while current dietary recommendations are to increase the intake of antioxidant-rich foods rather than supplement specific nutrients. Many alternatives to refined sugar are available, including raw cane sugar, plant saps/syrups (eg, maple syrup, agave nectar), molasses, honey, and fruit sugars (eg, date sugar). Unrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants, similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain products. OBJECTIVE: To"
