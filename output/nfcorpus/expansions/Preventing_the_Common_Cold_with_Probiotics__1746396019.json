    "Preventing the common cold with probiotics is a topic that has gained attention in recent years. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that are known to support the immune system and promote overall health. While more research is needed to definitively prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the common cold, some studies have shown promising results.\n\nProbiotics work by helping to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut, which is important for immune function.

    "Preventing the common cold with probiotics is a topic of ongoing research and interest. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help support a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which in turn may enhance the immune system. While probiotics have shown some promise in reducing the severity and duration of colds in some studies, more research is needed to fully understand their role in preventing the common cold. Incorporating probiotic-rich foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kombucha into your diet may help support overall immune health, but it's important to also focus on other preventative measures such as hand hygiene, adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables to reduce your risk of catching a cold. Consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements or probiotics is always recommended to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your individual health needs."

    "Probiotics for preventing acute upper respiratory tract infections.\tBACKGROUND: Probiotics may improve a person's health by regulating their immune function. Some studies show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. However, no evidence of the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and related potential adverse effects has been published. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing acute URTIs. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to May week 1, 2011)",

    "Probiotics as prevention and treatment for diarrhea.\tPURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically appraise evidence on probiotic use for prevention and treatment of diarrhea in children and adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggested that probiotics are effective in primary and secondary prevention of gastroenteritis and its treatment. Selected Lactobacillus strains had a modest, although significant effect in primary prevention. Saccharomyces boulardii was effective in antibiotic-associated and in Clostridium difficile diarrhea. There is evidence that it might prevent diarrhea in day-care centers. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was associated with reduced diarrheal duration and severity, more evident in case of childhood Rotavirus diarrhea. Similar, although weaker, evidence was",
    "Sleep Habits and Susceptibility to the Common Cold\tBackground Sleep quality is thought to be an important predictor of immunity and in turn susceptibility to the common cold. This article examines whether sleep duration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral exposure are associated with cold susceptibility. Methods Participants were 153 healthy men and women volunteers, ages 21\u201355. For 14 consecutive days, they reported their sleep duration and sleep efficiency (percent of time in bed actually asleep) for the previous night, and whether they felt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were calculated over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, participants were administered nasal drops containing a rhinovirus, quarantined and monitored on the day",
