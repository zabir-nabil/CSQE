    "Cellulite is a common concern for many individuals, especially women. It often appears as dimpled, lumpy skin on areas like the thighs, hips, and buttocks. While genetics and other factors play a role in its development, diet can also have an impact on the presence of cellulite.\n\nA diet rich in unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can contribute to the formation of cellulite. These foods can lead to weight gain and an increase in fat storage, which can make cellulite more noticeable. On the other hand, a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce the appearance of cellulite.\n\nDrinking plenty of water is also important for overall skin health and can help reduce the appearance of cellulite. Staying hydrated helps maintain skin elasticity and flush out toxins that can contribute to the development of cellulite.\n\nIn addition to a healthy diet, regular exercise can also play a crucial role in reducing cellulite. Incorporating both cardio and strength training exercises can help burn fat, build muscle, and improve overall skin tone, which can make cellulite less visible.\n\nWhile diet alone may not completely eliminate cellulite, making healthy food choices and staying hydrated can certainly help reduce its appearance and improve skin health overall.",
    "Cellulite is a common concern for many individuals and is often associated with factors like genetics, hormones, lifestyle, and diet. While diet alone may not completely eliminate cellulite, making certain dietary changes can help improve the appearance of cellulite and overall skin health. \n\nEating a well-balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can provide important nutrients and antioxidants that support skin health and elasticity. These foods can also help reduce inflammation and promote circulation, which may help diminish the appearance of cellulite.\n\nIt is also important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Proper hydration can help maintain skin elasticity and reduce the dimpled appearance of cellulite.\n\nAdditionally, limiting the consumption of processed foods, sugary snacks, and excessive amounts of salt can help reduce fluid retention and inflammation, both of which can contribute to the development of cellulite. Incorporating lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber into your diet can also help support a healthy weight and reduce the accumulation of excess fat that can exacerbate the appearance of cellulite.\n\nWhile diet is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to reducing cellulite, making these dietary changes along with regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle can help improve the overall health and appearance of your skin."

    "Diet and Cellulite, Cellulite, which appears as orange peel-type or cottage cheese-like dimpling of the skin on the thighs and buttocks, is a complex, multifactorial, cosmetic disorder of the subcutaneous fat layer and the overlying superficial skin. Although extracellular matrix and lymphatic system disorders can increase its appearance, cellulite basically results from excessive fat storage in the adipose tissue which exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding skin tissue and creates a dimpled irregular appearance. Only a limited number of studies on cellulite have been published in the international literature and many of them reach somewhat antithetical conclusions.",
    "Diet and Cellulite, Adiponectin expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue is reduced in women with cellulite. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone mainly produced by subcutaneous fat that shows important protective anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects. We hypothesized that adiponectin expressed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) might play a role in the pathogenesis of cellulite. Most adult women exhibit cellulite on the hips, buttock, and thighs. Cellulite basically results from an excessive fat storage in the adipose tissue which exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding skin tissue and creates a dimpled irregular appearance. Caffeine, the most widely used anti-cellulite ingredient, favors fat break-down by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme. Diet and Cellulite."

    "In vitro and in vivo efficacy of sulfo-carrabiose, a sugar-based cosmetic ingredient with anti-cellulite properties.\tMost of adult women exhibit cellulite on the hips, buttock and thighs. Although extracellular matrix and lymphatic system disorders can increase its appearance, cellulite basically results from an excessive fat storage in the adipose tissue which exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding skin tissue and creates a dimpled irregular appearance. Caffeine, the most widely used anti-cellulite ingredient, favours fat break-down by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme and encouraging a high intracellular level of cAMP. A series of studies has shown that spermine and spermidine, two ubiquitous polyamines, encouraged fat storage and slowed",
    "Cellulite: nature and aetiopathogenesis.\tOnly a limited number of studies on cellulite have been published in the international literature and many of them reach somewhat antithetical conclusions. Consequently, it is not yet possible to reconcile the extreme differences of opinion which have lingered on for years concerning the nature of this disorder, as well as its origin and even the most basic aspects of its histopathological classification. It does not even have a recognized name: in fact, the term 'cellulitis' is used in scientific English to indicate a spreading gangrenous infection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The other terms used from time to time [panniculitis, lipodystrophy, edematofibrosclerotic panniculitis (EFP), liposclerosis",
    "Vegetarian diet for patients with rheumatoid arthritis--status: two years after introduction of the diet.\tWe have previously reported that a significant improvement can be obtained in rheumatoid arthritis patients by fasting followed by an individually adjusted vegetarian diet for one year. The patients who changed their diet could be divided into diet responders and diet nonresponders. After the clinical trial the patients were free to change diet or medication and after approximately one year they were asked to attend a new clinical examination. We compared the change from baseline (i.e. at the time of study entry) to the time of the follow-up examination for diet responders, diet nonresponders and controls who ate an omnivorous diet",
    "Mediterranean and low-fat diets improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men.\tBACKGROUND: The regulatory function of the endothelium is altered in hypercholesterolemia, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients is affected by replacing a saturated fat-enriched diet with a low-fat, low-saturated fat diet (the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program stage 1 [NCEP-1] diet) or a diet rich in monounsaturated fat (such as that common in Mediterranean countries). DESIGN: Intervention dietary study with a baseline phase and two randomized crossover dietary periods. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Reina Sof\u00eda, C\u00f3rdoba",
    "Effects of increased dietary protein-to-carbohydrate ratios in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\tBACKGROUND: Some evidence has suggested that a diet with a higher ratio of protein to carbohydrates has metabolic advantages in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of a high-protein (HP) diet to a standard-protein (SP) diet in women with PCOS. DESIGN: A controlled, 6-mo trial was conducted in 57 PCOS women. The women were assigned through rank minimization to one of the following 2 diets without caloric restriction: an HP diet (>40% of energy from",
    "The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome param...\tOne of the proposed causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome is the excessive intake of products containing added sugars, in particular, fructose. Although the ability of excessive intake of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome is mounting, to date, no study has addressed whether a diet specifically lowering fructose but not total carbohydrates can reduce features of metabolic syndrome. A total of 131 patients were randomized to compare the short-term effects of 2 energy-restricted diets-a low-fructose diet vs a moderate natural fructose diet-on",
    "A legume-based hypocaloric diet reduces proinflammatory status and improves metabolic features in overweight/obese subjects.\tBACKGROUND: The nutritional composition of the dietary intake could produce specific effects on metabolic variables and inflammatory marker concentrations. This study assessed the effects of two hypocaloric diets (legume-restricted- vs. legume-based diet) on metabolic and inflammatory changes, accompanying weight loss. METHODS: Thirty obese subjects (17 M/13F; BMI: 32.5 \u00b1 4.5 kg/m(2); 36 \u00b1 8 years) were randomly assigned to one of the following hypocaloric treatments (8 weeks): Calorie-restricted legume-free diet (Control: C-diet) or calorie-restricted legume-",
    "A low-fat vegan diet and a conventional diabetes diet in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a randomized, controlled, 74-wk clinical trial\tBackground: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardiovascular health. Objective: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight, and plasma lipids. Design: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n = 49) or a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n = 50) for 74 wk.

    "Chronic effects of a high-fat diet enriched with virgin olive oil and a low-fat diet enriched with alpha-linolenic acid on postprandial endothelial...\tTraditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with endothelial dysfunction. The vascular endothelium plays a key role in local vascular tone regulation and can be modulated by dietary fat. We propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), all fractions"
