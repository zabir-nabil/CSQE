    "Convergence of evidence refers to the idea that conclusions become more reliable and valid when multiple sources of evidence support the same hypothesis or theory. When different types of evidence, from various methods or studies, consistently point towards the same conclusion, confidence in the accuracy and robustness of that conclusion increases. This convergence not only strengthens the evidence itself but also enhances the overall credibility of the findings. In scientific research, the convergence of evidence is highly valued as it helps to establish more solid and well-supported conclusions, reducing the influence of potential biases or errors associated with relying on a single source of evidence. By considering multiple perspectives and types of evidence, researchers can build a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of the phenomena they are investigating.",
    "Convergence of evidence refers to the idea that when multiple sources of data or information point towards the same conclusion, the likelihood of that conclusion being accurate is increased. This concept is widely used in scientific research, where researchers aim to compile data from various experiments, studies, and observations to support their findings. By examining the patterns and consistency across different sources of evidence, researchers can have more confidence in the validity of their conclusions. Convergence of evidence is essential for building a strong research base and for drawing reliable and well-supported conclusions."

    "The longer-term impacts of Western diet on human cognition and the brain.\tAnimal work over the last three decades has generated a convincing body of evidence that a Western diet - one high in saturated fat and refined carbohydrates (HFS diet) - can damage various brain systems. In this review we examine whether there is evidence for this in humans, using converging lines of evidence from neuropsychological, epidemiological and neuroimaging data. Using the animal research as the organizing principal, we examined evidence for dietary induced impairments in frontal, limbic and hippocampal systems, and with their associated functions in learning, memory, cognition and hedonics. Evidence for the role of HFS diet in attention",
    "Nearwork-induced transient myopia (NITM) and permanent myopia--is there a link?\tMyopia is a worldwide public health problem. However, its understanding is incomplete, and many of its preventative and therapeutic aspects remain controversial. Nearwork is a primary, environmentally based factor in the aetiology of permanent myopia (PM), with nearwork-induced transient myopia (NITM) being a possible contributory component. A relationship between PM and NITM has been suggested, but that connection has remained somewhat indirect and elusive. However, based on recent converging evidence from clinical, laboratory and modelling studies, a five-fold argument will be advanced for a possible link between PM and NITM",
    "Nutritional modulation of cognitive function and mental health.\tThe important role of diet in cardiometabolic health is generally well recognised; for mental health, it is not so well understood. However, lifestyle risk factors for poor physical health are the same risk factors for mental illness, including poor diet. This is reflected by the high level of poor physical health in people with mental illness. Mediterranean, whole food diets have been associated with reduced risk for chronic disease, but very little research has investigated their mental health benefits. We provide a model for the pathways by which food components provided by a Mediterranean-style diet can facilitate healthy brain function. We then review evidence for",
    "Phosphate is a vascular toxin.\tElevated phosphate (P) levels are seen in advanced renal failure and, together with dysregulated calcium, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels, contribute to the complex of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD). Converging evidence from in vitro, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that increased P is associated with vascular calcification and mortality. When vessels are exposed to high P conditions in vitro, they develop apoptosis, convert to bone-like cells and develop extensive calcification. Clinical studies in children on dialysis show that high P is associated with increased vessel wall thickness, arterial stiffness and coronary calcification. Epidemiological studies in adult",
    "Shared signals and the potential for phylogenetic espionage between plants and animals.\tUntil recently, the study and understanding of plant and animal signalling and response mechanisms have developed independently. Recent biochemical and molecular work is producing a growing list of elements involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli that are very similar across kingdoms. Some of the more interesting examples of these include prostaglandin/octadecanoid-mediated responses to wounding, steroid-based signalling systems, and pathogen-recognition mechanisms. Some of these similarities probably represent evolutionary convergence; others may be ancestral to plants and animals. Ecological and evolutionary implications of such overlaps include the existence of pathogens that can cause disease in plants and animals",
    "Comparative and meta-analytic insights into life extension via dietary restriction.\tDietary restriction (DR) extends the lifespan of a wide range of species, although the universality of this effect has never been quantitatively examined. Here, we report the first comprehensive comparative meta-analysis of DR across studies and species. Overall, DR significantly increased lifespan, but this effect is modulated by several factors. In general, DR has less effect in extending lifespan in males and also in non-model organisms. Surprisingly, the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension via DR than the degree of caloric restriction. Furthermore, we show that reduction in both age-dependent",
    "Why do centenarians escape or postpone cancer? The role of IGF-1, inflammation and p53.\tBACKGROUND: Centenarians are exceptionally long living individuals who escaped the most common age-related diseases. In particular they appear to be effectively protected from cancers. The mechanisms that underlie this protection are quite complex and still largely unclear. AIM: To critically analyse the literature in order to propose a unifying hypothesis that can account for this cancer protection in centenarians. METHODS: Review of the scientific literature regarding three main players in tumourigenesis such as IGF-1, inflammation and p53, and centenarians. RESULTS: Centenarians appear to be characterised by low IGF-1-mediated responses and high levels of anti-",
    "Advanced glycation end products as biomarkers and gerontotoxins - A basis to explore methylglyoxal-lowering agents for Alzheimer's disease?\tAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementing disorder of late life. Although there might be various different triggering events in the early stages of the disease, they seem to converge on a few characteristic final pathways in the late stages, characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we put forward the hypothesis that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their precursors, including methylglyoxal, are both biomarkers and causative agents (\"gerontotoxins\") characteristic for this disorder. Accumulation of AGEs is a normal feature of aging, but is",
    "Potential role of FoxO1 and mTORC1 in the pathogenesis of Western diet-induced acne\tAcne in adolescents of developed countries is an epidemic skin disease and has currently been linked to the Western diet (WD). It is the intention of this viewpoint to discuss the possible impact of WD-mediated nutrient signalling in the pathogenesis of acne. High glycaemic load and dairy protein consumption both increase insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signalling (IIS) that is superimposed on elevated IGF-1 signalling of puberty. The cell's nutritional status is primarily sensed by the forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FoxO1) and the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have evaluated, in vitro and in vivo, the effects of BAY 86-9766, a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines with primary or acquired resistance to cetuximab. RESULTS: Among the colorectal cancer cell lines, five with a KRAS mutation (LOVO, HCT116, HCT15, SW620, and SW480) and one with a BRAF"
